  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The first two chapters of this book were published
more than a year ago in the <cite>Army and Navy Magazine</cite>,
and are reprinted with the kind permission of the
proprietors, Messrs. W. H. Allen &#38; Co. The other
chapters were written about the same time, as articles
for the same Magazine, but not being sufficiently
within the scope of a military and naval periodical, it
was resolved to produce them in the present form.
The author, in the course of a long career in the
Bengal Civil Service, has held nearly all the appointments
which he has attempted to describe in connection
with that service, and he had many opportunities of
becoming acquainted with all the mechanism of Indian
government, as seen from Calcutta and the Lower
Provinces of Bengal. In his attempt to give a sketch
of social life in India, it must be remembered that he
is writing chiefly of the Lower Provinces of Bengal.
He has endeavoured to avoid anything which might
give personal offence, and he would gladly adopt as his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>motto, “<i><span lang="la">Ridentem dicere verum quid vetat?</span></i>” It is
hoped that this book may afford some entertainment
to those who have been in India, and that it may be of
use and interest to those young men who are thinking
of devoting themselves to a professional career in India.
It only remains to observe that these papers were
written before the recent agitation in connection with
the Ilbert Bill, but it has not been found necessary to
alter anything that had been written as regards either
the English residents or the native community.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>There are two different classes of people who know
very little about India. First there is your old Indian,
who fancies that he knows all about the presidency,
say Bombay, in which he spent his time, but is as
ignorant of the presidencies of Bengal and Madras
as he is of China and Japan. Secondly, there is your
real rural Englishman, who has had no relations or
connections in India, and is, perhaps, still grieving
over the untimely fate of some old friend who went
out and suddenly died in India. There undoubtedly
still exists in many English circles a considerable
amount of ignorance and a deep-rooted prejudice
against all things Indian. It is possible that this
prejudice may be traced back to the ways and manners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>of the East Indian Nabobs of the last century, whose
pompous display of wealth, suspected to have been
acquired by dubious practices, was an offence and a
scandal to the quiet English country gentleman, and,
indeed, to all who did not contrive slyly to make a
profit out of the Nabob’s money. The Nabob himself
was usually shy and awkward, and almost always
irritable and irascible, and remarkable for his peculiar
social manners; so that it came to pass, that a general
idea prevailed that the picture presented by the Nabob
in England was but a reflection and reproduction of
the social manners which he had acquired during his
sojourn in the distant East. How far this feeling was
correct it is not our present purpose to inquire. The
race of Nabobs has come to an end. The pagoda-tree
of fabulous memory no longer bears its golden fruit.
An enormous change has come over the habits and
manners of those Englishmen who now practically
colonise India. For though colonisation is usually
spoken of in a different sense, the British inhabitants
of India are virtually a colony. The individual
colonists may change, but as fast as one man goes
another steps into his place; and thus it comes to pass
that over the whole length and breadth of India there
is now a large and continually growing colony of
English families, who endeavour to maintain their old
home feelings and to keep all those old surroundings
which remind them of the land of their birth, to which
they all hope in due course to return. They treasure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>in their hearts a warm and kindly remembrance of
their old home, and they live in the fond belief that
they may be well and kindly thought of by those
whom they have left behind.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is, however, certain that much ignorance, not unmixed
with the old anti-Nabob prejudice, still prevails
regarding the ways and habits of our countrymen in
India. The most absurd inquiries are addressed to people
who have been in India, which doubtless sometimes
provoke answers more suited to the intellectual acquirements
of the questioner than in actual accordance with
the real facts of the case. If your fair and charming
companion at a dinner-party persists in her conversation
in filling all Indian houses with snakes and scorpions,
she will be much more gratified to hear a few anecdotes
which accord with her own assertions, than she
would be to learn that it is possible to live for years
in some parts of India without seeing either a snake or
a scorpion. When recent editions of popular Indian
hand-books solemnly inform the reader that rhinoceros
hunting is an ordinary amusement in the suburbs
of Calcutta, it is much easier to acquiesce in that information
than to urge respectfully that alligators may
sometimes be found in the ornamental waters of Battersea
Park.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the greatest changes that has come over
India in the last thirty years is to be found in the very
great addition that has taken place to the numbers of
the non-official classes. Fifty years ago Indian society
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>consisted chiefly of the military and civil servants of
the Indian Government. In Calcutta the judges, barristers,
and other legal officials formed almost a
separate set in the local society. Then came the great
merchants, the representatives of the few but famous
old commercial houses, whose names were from time to
time mixed up with fabulous wealth and hopeless insolvency.
In the interior of the country there were
many parts where the face of a non-official European
was unknown, whilst in some districts a few hardy
Englishmen and Scotchmen were to be found engaged
in the precarious cultivation of indigo or the manufacture
of sugar, or in managing and farming the lands
of native land-owners. But, taken all together, the
non-official classes of Englishmen were counted by
hundreds, where now they are numbered by thousands.
In such a community the Governor-General and the
members of his Council were pre-eminently the makers
and rulers of society; and as in those days these great
official people did not all run away to the hills of
Simla and other mountain stations as soon as the
weather became hot, the impress of their authority was
never wanting in social life. The great annual ball at
Government House in Calcutta on the Queen’s birthday
(which is usually one of the hottest days of the
year) was looked forward to by all classes with the
deepest interest and anxiety, and it was on this occasion
especially that the pretty half-caste girls of Calcutta
had an opportunity of making their <em>début</em> in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>grand world, to make havoc of the hearts of the gay
young civilians and cadets and ensigns who were then
amongst the acknowledged rulers of the society in the
capital.</p>

<p class='c010'>But those were the days before the mutinies, and
before the introduction of railways. The steamers of
the Peninsula and Oriental and other companies had
not then a monopoly of passengers, and people still
went out to India in sailing vessels round the Cape of
Good Hope. There are some warm-hearted politicians
who imagine that the change of Government in India,
by the substitution of the name of the Queen for that of
the old East India Company, has conferred inestimable
benefits on all people who dwell in India. In one
sense they are quite correct, because the benefits referable
directly to this cause are almost as inestimable as
they are invisible to the mind’s eye. But that a great
change has come over the land since 1857 is undeniable.
The well-known Mr. John Marshman, the historian
of India, used to say that it was impossible to
do any good in a country like Bengal, or for a people
like the Bengalis, because, according to their national
proverb, it was “impossible to carve rotten wood.”
But the introduction of railways has almost falsified
the national proverb. Wherever the iron road pervades
the country, it gives a new basis of strength and
vitality on which a new growth of life can arise. It is
no exaggeration to say that this new power has affected
materially the whole European and native community,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>and has worked and is working the most important
social changes. By the use of the railway, the Viceroy
and the provincial governors are enabled to resort
without anxiety to the cool hill stations, from which
the electric telegraph flashes their orders to the
labourers in the hot vineyards of the plains. By the
railway the wealthy and pious Hindoo pilgrims are
enabled to proceed in ease and comfort to remote
sacred shrines, and at such a moderate cost that their
money-bags still contain ample store to propitiate the
priests in charge of the temples and their idols. The
wandering Caubul merchant no longer commits himself
and his caravan of camels to a tedious march of
several months to reach Calcutta, but stows himself,
with his Persian cats and rugs and pomegranates and
other wares, in the third-class carriage of a railway,
and finds himself at his journey’s end in a few days,
instead of months. Within the last few years it happened
that a distinguished political officer was summoned
from Quetta to Calcutta, a journey of about
two thousand miles by railway, to be consulted by the
Viceroy. He had scarcely returned to Quetta when a
telegram came summoning him back to Calcutta for
a further consultation. So that in less than a fortnight
he twice traversed the whole continent of India
without any great fatigue, and with very little risk to
his health.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would, perhaps, be difficult to find a stronger
contrast in illustration of the increased facilities of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>travelling which railways in India afford, than is to be
found in Bishop Heber’s celebrated journal, written
about 1824, and in Mr. James Caird’s letters describing
his recent visit to India in 1879. They both
covered nearly the same ground, though their routes
lay in different directions. The Bishop started eastwards
by boat from Calcutta to Dacca. He took six
weeks on his journey, and his chaplain died of illness
contracted on the way. By railway and steamer
Mr. Caird travelled from Calcutta to Dacca in about
twenty-four hours. The Bishop set out again in his
boat from Dacca to Allahabad, and accomplished the
distance, which is about seven hundred miles, in nearly
three months. Mr. Caird was enabled to cover the same
distance by railway and steamer in three days. The
Bishop went forth on horseback from Allahabad with a
military escort to protect his tents and baggage, and
made an erratic journey through the then independent
province of Oude, and to the hill-station of Almora,
and eventually through the principal cities of Rajpootana
and Western India until he reached Bombay.
This pilgrimage necessarily lasted for several months,
as his progress was at the rate of about ten miles a
day. Mr. Caird, by the help of the railways, started
from Bombay and reached Allahabad, after visiting
Oude, in about ten days. In fact a fortnight, or at
the longest a month, is now deemed amply sufficient
time for the travelling tourist to do India. And what
is the result? In Bishop Heber’s journal the reader
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>will find a series of faithful and kindly observations on
the ways and manners of the people amongst whom
he lived and journeyed day after day, whilst his
remarks on the state of the crops are sound and intelligent,
as being based on his own practical knowledge
of the cultivation of the glebe of his English parish.
In the letters of Mr. Caird and in other modern travellers,
we find too many hasty conclusions such as are
usually formed from rapid and imperfect observation.
Mr. Caird’s knowledge of English agriculture may
be unrivalled, but he had about the same opportunity
of forming an opinion on Indian agriculture and the
various measures necessary for its development, as the
hero of the old story in “Scholasticus,” who was
expected to form an opinion of a house from the
inspection of a single brick.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the improved facilities of communication with
England, and also between the various parts of India,
a great change has necessarily come over the social
habits of Englishmen residing in India. The official
classes have lost a great portion of their social influence,
whilst the non-official classes have gained a
corresponding advantage and position. This is due
to many causes, partly to the mere force of numbers,
partly to the different distribution of wealth and
means, and in some places individual character has,
as usual, contributed considerably to the change. We
will endeavour to go into some detail as to the difference
which is shown in different stages and classes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>society, and it will be for our readers to judge whether
the profit or loss, the gain or the disadvantage, lies
with the present or the past generation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Governor-General of India has always been the
chief fountain of honour, and the first pillar of the
state and of all social influence. His dignity is now
still further enhanced, as, under the title of Viceroy,
His Excellency shines forth as the direct representative
of his sovereign. But as regards this high position,
so much depends on personal character and
manners, that it would be difficult to arrive at a
decision when contrasting the quiet dignity of Lord
Canning or the genial presence of Lord Mayo with the
haughty extravagance of Lord Ellenborough or the
solid and imperturbable majesty of Lord Dalhousie.
There is, however, a more persistent and successful
endeavour under the modern <em>régime</em> to maintain the
credit of Government House for hospitality, and what
is vulgarly called entertainment. There are now ten
people to be entertained where there was formerly
only one. The Viceroy lives for eight months of the
year at Simla, and for the remaining four months in
Calcutta. At Simla the society is, to a great extent,
official, swollen by the numerous representatives of
the army with their families, who seek refuge at Simla
from the fearful heat of the plains of Northern and
Central India. A weekly dinner at Government
House, and two or three State balls, suffice at Simla
to provide for the gratification of the visitors, whilst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the staff and household of the Viceroy, especially with
Lord W. Beresford to guide them, used to contribute
not a little to keep the ball of amusement rolling in all
phases of society.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Viceroy and his suite descend to Calcutta
in November, the usual notices are issued for a levee
and a drawing-room. On several occasions in recent
years an attempt has been made to induce all the
ladies of Calcutta to appear at the drawing-room
with trains and feathers, but it has usually been left
optional to them, the result being that the trains and
feathers which do appear sometimes afford a sort of
clue to the character and social position of the lady
who wears them. The ladies who have the private
<em>entrée</em> at Government House make their bow first
before the Viceroy’s wife, and then, with the gentlemen
of their families, stand on either side of the
Viceroy’s throne, in a sort of sacred semi-circle, in
support of the Queen’s representative. The ladies
who have not the private <em>entrée</em> are then admitted,
and presented in the order of their arrival. There are
always a few beautiful and graceful English women in
Calcutta, who would be an ornament to any European
Court. Very few native ladies appear at the drawing-room,
but a stout and stately olive-complexioned
East Indian (half-caste) lady sometimes sweeps by,
waving her ostrich plumes and with a train of golden
tissue twenty-four feet long; and she is, perhaps,
succeeded by a lady from Burmah, where the lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>part of the female costume scarcely amounts to a
single petticoat. When the drawing-room is over, the
ladies who have been presented are ushered into the
upper drawing-room or ball-room of Government
House, where they can rejoin the gentlemen under
whose escort they came in their carriages to Government
House. Long buffets are laid out with everything
that is needed to refresh them after their exertions,
and the band plays for about an hour, until
they quietly disperse to their homes. This is an excellent
arrangement, as it affords the ladies a suitable
opportunity of displaying their dresses, and seeing
their friends’ dresses, and receiving the admiration
to which they are entitled. About four hundred
ladies usually appear at the drawing-rooms in Calcutta.</p>

<p class='c010'>The levee for men, which is held a day or two
before or after the drawing-room, is a much less
interesting, but more fatiguing business. Every man
in Calcutta, European or Native, who can get the
necessary vouchers for his admission, seems to make
it his duty and his pleasure to attend. If he attends
the levee, there is the chance that he may receive an
invitation to dinner at Government House, or, more
probably, to one of the great balls or “at homes”
which are annually given by the Viceroy. Therefore,
every European assistant and every clerk in the merchants’
offices, and banks, or in Government employment,
strives for admission to the levee. Every native
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>gentleman, who can obtain letters commendatory, is
anxious to make his obeisance before the Viceroy.
The great people, such as the members of Council, the
judges of the High Court, the members of the Board
of Revenue, and the secretaries of the Government,
with the several military chiefs and heads of departments,
who have the private <em>entrée</em> to Government
House, are first presented to the Viceroy, and pay
the penalty for their precedence by having to stand
during the whole levee on either side of the Viceregal
throne. A distant noise like the roaring of the sea
is next heard, and there presently appears a heated
and excited party of the representatives of the outside
public, who have been successful in struggling to the
front places and in being admitted first through the
series of barriers by which the impatient crowd, numbering
about twelve hundred, has to be restrained.
The struggle to get to the front is something fearful
until the protection of the first barrier is reached.
Coat-tails are torn off, swords in their scabbards
broken, hats treated as foot-balls, as the body of eager
aspirants crushes forward. It is almost a comfort to
find a soft place on this occasion between two fat and
portly native gentlemen, who suffer grievously, but
still gladly, for the honour and glory which they presently
hope to attain. Several of the early barriers
which have been already mentioned are kept against
the crowd by non-commissioned officers, but as the
candidates approach the throne, they come under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>manipulation of the A.D.C.s and other officers on
the staff, whose brilliant appearance sometimes seems
almost to fascinate the mind of the uninitiated. At
last the foremost comer is bidden by the A.D.C. to
advance, card in hand, to meet his Viceregal master.
He steps forward and hands his card to the Military
Secretary, who announces his name in a loud voice,
and the next two paces bring him in front of the
Viceroy. Some men make a proper obeisance and
pass on. Some give a little sort of a nod to the
Viceroy, and, looking bewildered, try to retire by the
way they had advanced, when an A.D.C. promptly
interferes. A difficult case sometimes arises, when the
Viceroy, on recognising someone to whom he desires
to be gracious, puts forth his hand to be shaken. This
proceeding being observed by the man who comes
next, he cheerfully puts forth his hand to be shaken
by the Viceroy, but meeting with no reciprocity, he
slinks off in dismay.</p>

<p class='c010'>Military uniform and the ordinary evening dress of
civilians are the principal costumes. But the native
gentlemen who appear present every variety of dress,
more or less national or fanciful, according to their
taste. A great deal of misunderstanding exists, unfortunately,
on the subject of native dress. It is the
present fashion with educated natives to despise the old
simple national costume, and to profess to regard it as
typical of servile submission to a conquering race. A
young educated Bengali would not condescend to wear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>a robe of fine white muslin and a white turban (containing,
perhaps, a hundred yards of the finest muslin),
in which dress his father and grandfather were so
becomingly arrayed. A new kind of turban has been
invented for them of some coloured stiff material, and
their body-dress is a long sort of single-breasted Noah’s
Ark garment, of cloth or silk, reaching nearly down to
the ancles. White stockings and patent-leather shoes
or boots are considered very correct, and sometimes
cloth trousers are visible above the boots, but not unfrequently
this portion of European costume is wanting,
and the native garment called a <em>dhooti</em> lurks
beneath the Noah’s Ark coat. Thus arrayed, the
wealthy young Bengali presents himself before the
Viceroy. A comparatively recent fashion for educated
native gentlemen is to appear in their college caps and
gowns, which indicate the high degrees that they have
taken in the local universities. But, perhaps, really
the proudest man among them is he who assumes a
regular English evening costume, with his head bare
like a Briton, his beautiful black hair richly oiled and
curled, and a white tie round his neck, and white kid
gloves on his hands. From this it is evident to all
the world that his mind and body have really achieved
practical independence, and that he is on perfect
equality with his foreign rulers.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the levee must come to an end. The officers of
the Volunteer corps who have been engaged on duty
are presented to the Viceroy, and, finally, the native
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>officers of the native regiments which have been on
duty are brought up and go through the very graceful
ceremony of proffering the hilts of their swords to His
Excellency. The hundreds who have attended the
levee then disperse to their homes, no refreshment
being provided after the levee, although, as has been
mentioned, the ladies, after the drawing-room, are
more kindly treated. Every man, therefore, seeks the
earliest opportunity of quenching his thirst at his own
house or club, and the pipe of peace probably consoles
him for all the loss of temper and damage of apparel
which he sustained in struggling into the presence of
the Viceroy. It is only fair to admit that it is reported
in the Indian papers that at Lord Ripon’s levees a successful
attempt has been made to prevent all the crushing
and struggling among the men for priority, which
had been so disgracefully prevalent at previous levees.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been mentioned above that most of the men
who go to the levee, do so in the hope of getting an
invitation to dinner at Government House, or, at least,
to one of the balls, or “at homes,” or garden-parties,
which are given by the Viceroy in the course of the
season. With regard to the dinner invitations, there
are always one or more experienced A.D.C.’s on the
Staff who are careful to weed the dinner-list judiciously;
but with huge weekly or bi-weekly dinners of
sixty or eighty persons, the Viceroy generally manages
to gratify the vanity, and satisfy the appetite of most
of his ambitious visitors and their wives in the course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of the season. Doubtless much heart-burning exists
on the part of those who are not invited to these
feasts, especially when they know that any friends of
their own immediate circle are invited, and find themselves
omitted. The A.D.C.-in-waiting sometimes has
to receive an irascible visitor who wants to know the
reason why he and his spouse have not been invited to
dinner; and letters of remonstrance on this subject
are believed to be by no means uncommon. But “a
mild answer turneth away wrath,” and there is no
instance on record of the A.D.C. having ever suffered
from the much-threatened horsewhip.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are very few native gentlemen who care to
meet their European brethren at the dinner-table, and
they, therefore, seldom appear at the Government
House dinner-parties. It is not that our native friends,
especially of the wealthy and educated classes, do not
appreciate a dinner in the English or European style,
but, for reasons which it is not easy to explain satisfactorily,
they seem to prefer to indulge themselves with
such meals in the privacy of their own houses. It has
also been considered advisable, of late years, not to
invite native gentlemen to the balls at Government
House. The reason for this can be put in a very
simple form. The native gentleman does not bring his
wife or daughters to the dance, and he himself does
not dance. Therefore his presence in a ball-room is
unnecessary. This explanation does not cover the
whole of the case, but it is sufficient for our present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>purpose. Almost everyone knows that native ideas
on the subject of dancing differ almost entirely from
our own. Perhaps it may be permissible to mention
one very notable exception to ordinary native habits
in the matter of dancing. We refer to a young Rajah,
the ruler of a semi-independent province, who has had
the good fortune to be brought up under most judicious
and capable English tutors and guardians. This
young prince is equally good at polo and rackets and
lawn-tennis, and most other European sports. He is
a first-rate shot and a very fair horseman. In a ball-room
his success is unmistakeable, and as he has the
manners of an English gentleman (than which we can
offer no higher compliment), he is also fortunate in
having so mastered all the difficulties of waltzing, that
it is generally understood that he is accepted by the
best dancers in a ball-room as a very welcome partner.
He wears a sort of semi-military costume, with a velvet
tunic slightly braided with gold, and it would be difficult
to find any man more thoroughly conversant with
all social etiquette, or more familiar with the colloquial
niceties of the English language.</p>

<p class='c010'>In order, therefore, to suit the tastes of the great
majority of the native gentlemen who wish to display
their loyalty, the Viceroy gives several evening parties,
which are known as “at homes”; and these are varied
by garden-parties in the gardens adjoining Government
House, which take place about sunset, and are
continued until dark, when the grounds and adjacent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>buildings are lit up with a brilliant illumination. The
“at homes” take place indoors, and as there is no
dancing or music they are not very lively entertainments;
but an “at home” everywhere depends chiefly
on the capacity of those who are invited to entertain
themselves from their own resources, and this element
is not strong amongst our native friends. At a garden-party
they are much more at ease and happy. They
can bring their little grand-children to the garden-party
and see the pleasure which the children enjoy,
and the admiration which they sometimes attract.
This is rather a curious feature in native society. The
grandfather cannot bring out his wife or his daughter,
according to native usage, so he appears in charge of
his grand-children. The grandfather himself may be
of the mature age of forty-five. His married daughter
is perhaps about twenty-five, and the grand-children
are usually under ten years of age. Little native girls
of that age are exceedingly picturesque, and often
absolutely pretty, but about that age they are married,
and withdrawn from the gaze of the outer world.
Certainly the customs and habits of our native friends
are mysterious; but there is no occasion to pity them
because they firmly believe that though their ways
are not as our ways, they are in every respect much
preferable and superior to those of the European
strangers.</p>

<p class='c010'>We may say one word, before parting, regarding
the balls given by the Viceroy at Government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>House in Calcutta. There are occasionally what
are called small dances, when about 150 or 200 of the
“upper ten” are invited; but a real <em>dignity-ball</em>
means the issue of above 1,200 invitations, which are
intended to include all whose names are on what is
called “the Government House List.” It is a very
pretty and interesting sight when the room is crowded,
about 10 o’clock, and the Viceroy with his wife and
their private friends, and staff, make their appearance
in procession and take their places for the opening
quadrille. A sacred space is corded off for the
Viceroy’s quadrille, the ends of the cords being held
or guarded by some of the handsome young privates
of the Viceroy’s native body-guard, in their gorgeous
scarlet uniforms and plumed head-dresses. These
body-guard men are quite a study, as they stand gazing
imperturbably on the dazzling scene. In the early
and crowded part of a Government House ball, it is
usually expedient to walk about with someone who
is able to criticise the appearance and dresses of the
ladies. There are representatives of nearly all nations,
and some of the Armenian and Jewish ladies are
conspicuous for the splendid diamonds and gorgeous
semi-oriental dresses which they wear. The ball-room
usually looks very bright with the numerous military
uniforms and political and diplomatic costumes, which
present a happy contrast to the ordinary civilian evening
dress. It might be deemed impertinent to go into detail
regarding the dresses of the ladies, but a critical eye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>can usually distinguish the fashions of at least three
years, the latest arrived belles exhibiting the modes
of the latest London season, whilst many are about
a year out of date, and a few still adhere to the dresses
which were in vogue two years before. However, the
dancing is always carried on with much spirit, and
there is no lack of good partners for those pretty girls
who are seen to dance well. About 12 o’clock supper
is announced, and a move is made to the supper-room
on the next floor, where there is never any want of all
that is needed to cheer the heart of man or woman.
Usually the Viceroy retires soon after supper, and
probably has an hour of telegrams and urgent business
to get through before he can go to sleep. The rest of
the company carry on the ball until the programme
is exhausted, and even the most large-hearted <em>chaperones</em>
are obliged to ask the A.D.C.’s to allow no more
extra dances. And so, about 3 o’clock in the morning,
Government House relapses into silence and repose.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='c009'>MEMBERS OF COUNCIL AND LIEUT.-GOVERNORS OF BENGAL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the Indian hierarchy H.E. the Commander-in-Chief
of India comes next in rank and position to
H.E. the Viceroy and Governor-General. But although
to all military men “the Chief” is naturally
the most important personage professionally, it is
seldom that “the Chief” and his <em>entourage</em> make a
very deep impression on the social life of the country.
There is a sort of military court-circle whilst the
Chief resides at his summer quarters at Simla, where
he holds periodical levees, and gives dinner-parties and
picnics, and sometimes a ball, but that is chiefly to
his official friends and acquaintances. When the
Chief descends to Calcutta, he occupies the house
assigned to him in Fort William, and thereby unintentionally
assumes a sort of exclusive position against
non-official society. It is not every merchant or
barrister or other civilian who has time or courage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>to face all the sentries, and cross all the drawbridges
of the fort, which hedge the divinity of the Chief.
The fort is a sort of large and ingenious rat-trap, in
which there is one cardinal rule—that you must not
retrace your steps, or go out by the gate through
which you entered. Sentries bristle at every corner,
sometimes English, sometimes native soldiers; all
evidently full of aversion to stray visitors. So that
when you have at last scaled the Chief’s staircase and
written your name in his visiting-book, under the
supervision of a good-looking A.D.C., you make your
retreat with considerable satisfaction, and with a
feeling of profound relief as soon as you find yourself
again outside the precincts of the fort. The official
position of the Chief is also somewhat anomalous, as
he is a member of the Viceroy’s Council, although
there is also a Military member of the Council, whose
function it is to advise the Viceroy on military
matters, and thus apparently to keep the Chief under
a sort of control. Theoretically it may be presumed
that the Chief should be at the head of his army,
wherever it is engaged in war. This was actually
the case when Lord Gough was Commander-in-Chief
in the great campaigns in the Punjab, when the Sikh
army threatened our existence. And still more so
was it the rule during the mutinies of 1857–58, when
Lord Clyde, as Commander-in-Chief, shared all the
perils and labours of those brave men who then
reconquered India. But in later times, and also before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>the mutinies, it was not always so. It is a matter of
tradition that Sir William Gomm was the best man
at Simla at the interesting game of cup and ball,
there being only one civilian who could, but would
not, beat him at it. In the days of Sir William Mansfield
his excessive zeal in the domestic economy of his
household led to scandals and a court-martial, which
has become only too famous in military history.
When Lord Napier of Magdala was Chief, the state of
India was generally peaceful; and although the late
genial Commander-in-Chief would gladly have taken
the command in person in the late Afghan campaign,
it was not permitted to him to do so. It is to be hoped
that no opportunity may be afforded to the present
Commander-in-Chief, Sir Donald Stewart, to take the
field in person; but, if the occasion should arise, there
are few who know Sir Donald Stewart who would not
again gladly serve under him.</p>

<p class='c010'>We come next to the Members of the Viceroy’s
Executive Council. The word “executive” indicates
a marked distinction from the “additional” members
of the Council of the Viceroy. “Executive” means
£8,000 a year. “Additional” means no pay, or
merely a slight increase of an existing official salary.
There are seven members of the Executive Council.
The Commander-in-Chief and the Military member
have been already mentioned. There is the Legislative
member, who is usually an English barrister. Two
members of the Civil Service represent, by turns, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the interests of the Bengal or the North-Western
Provinces, the other the rival Presidencies of Bombay
or Madras. There is also a member in special charge
of Public Works; this appointment was abolished,
but has been restored. Finally, there is the Financial
member, who may be either an ex-M.P., like Mr.
Wilson or Mr. Massey, or an ex-civilian, like Sir
Charles Trevelyan and Sir Richard Temple, or an ex-artilleryman,
as in the case of Major Baring. Each
of these fortunate men has a salary of £8,000 a year.
The pay used to be £10,000, but hard times brought
about a reduction; and one of the first victims of the
reduction announced his intention of meeting it by
reducing his charitable and other subscriptions by
20 per cent. It is hardly necessary to say that people
in the position of a Member of Council are considerably
victimised for subscriptions of every sort, from
contributions to statues in honour of departing Viceroys
down to the most useful and practical charitable
institutions. Thirty or forty years ago the Member
of Council was a man of much mark and social
influence in Calcutta. The Governor-General, in those
days, might go touring through remote provinces; but
the Members of his Council remained permanently in
the capital, and carried on the ordinary business of
government. The princely entertainments of Sir
Charles Metcalfe as a Member of Council are not
even yet forgotten. It is almost distressing to those
who remember Mr. Dorin’s hospitable establishment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>to see the fine old house now let as a lodging-house,
with half-a-dozen different families occupying flats or
rooms in it. Mr. Dorin had the credit of never having
been beyond sixteen miles from Calcutta, and then
only on a visit to the Governor-General at his country
seat at Barrackpore. But it would be tedious and
invidious to mention more of the old and honoured
names. Now matters are very different. The whole
Council migrates annually to Simla with the Viceroy,
and several of the members look upon their winter
residence in Calcutta with almost equal apprehension
for their health and their purse. As they contrive to
live about eight months of the year at Simla, they
naturally make it their head-quarters and home.
Some of them still keep up a house in Calcutta, which
they let during their absence at Simla. But those
who have no house of their own have either to pay an
enormous rent for a furnished house for the Calcutta
season, or live at a boarding-house or at one of the
clubs. The chief evidence of their presence in Calcutta
consists in the swarm of scarlet-coated servants who
hang about their doors. As they cannot keep carriages
at Simla, where only the Viceroy uses a carriage, they
have to hire their equipages from the job-masters in
Calcutta, for which they have, of course, to pay <em>season
prices</em>. Almost all the time that they spend in Calcutta
they are groaning over the expenditure which
they have to incur, for a Member of Council has
arrived at that time of life when the acquisition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>money is more pleasing than the spending of it. As
they stand on their dignity, and do not condescend to
call on any new comers, they are able to contract the
circle of their acquaintances; and thus they avoid the
expense of giving many large dinner-parties. Some
are, by their nature, more hospitably and socially disposed
than others, and less intent on economy. But
the Member of Council is no longer a very important
element in the Indian social system, and his absence
from the social circle would, perhaps, be not much
more noticed than his absence from the Council
Chamber would be regretted by some ardent reformers
who have no sufficient respect for his official position.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps it may be convenient to explain briefly the
official relation which exists between the Viceroy of
India and the Members of his Council. All the
orders of the Government of India issue in the name
of the Viceroy, and the language of the official letters
is so couched, that the uninstructed public believe
that each subject has received the personal consideration
of the Viceroy. But in reality, the
work that comes before the Government of India
is divided into several departments—the Political,
Financial, Home, Legislative, Military, and so on.
The Viceroy usually takes direct cognisance of only
one department, viz. the Political; a separate Member
of Council has the immediate control of each of the
other departments. The official papers are submitted
to the Viceroy and to each member of the Council in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>boxes, after they have been duly cooked and noted on
by the departmental secretary and his underlings. In
all ordinary matters of business, the member in charge
of the department passes his own orders, which is
usually done by signing his initials in approval of the
secretary’s proposals, and these orders issue in the
Viceroy’s name. In any difficult or doubtful cases,
the member directs that the papers are to be circulated
to the Viceroy and his colleagues, and under
this division of labour the work of the country is easily
carried on. Subjects on which there is any considerable
difference of opinion, or of very great importance,
are reserved for oral discussion by the Viceroy and
his colleagues at their weekly or special meetings in
the Council Chamber. As the Viceroy is held to be
personally responsible to Parliament for the administration
of India, his opinions usually prevail in Council,
and those Councillors who are wise in their generation
concur with their lord and master, whilst there remains
to the unconvinced and independent Councillor
the privilege of recording his dissent, for his own
satisfaction, and sometimes in the pleasing hope that
his minute may be laid before Parliament and read
by a sympathising British public. Notwithstanding
all this, there are some who have entertained a doubt
whether the use of each member of the Council is
altogether equivalent to the amount of his salary,
and have accordingly dared to recommend the abolition
of some of these appointments. But such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>persons are obviously little better than heretics and
infidels.</p>

<p class='c010'>If we have not put a very high estimate on the
social value of the Member of the Council during his
sojourn in Calcutta, let us try to depict him as he
dwells in his distant mountain home at Simla. Here
he lives a sort of suburban life, sometimes physically,
sometimes metaphorically, in the clouds. Doubtless
there are some glorious days and even weeks of fine
weather at Simla, and the change of climate to the
hills at first seems delicious to those who have come
up from a long and hot journey by the railway, or
who have been detained by their duty in the plains
until the hot winds and all the horrors of the hot
season have begun. But if Simla has its advantages,
it also has its serious drawbacks. There is seldom a
visitor who has not promptly to summon the aid of
the doctor, and only last year the chemists’ shops
were almost cleared out of all their stores of chlorodyne.
The highly rarefied air at an elevation of 7,000
feet above the level of the sea affects the circulation
and breathing of almost all new comers, and those
who have any organic affection are likely to suffer very
seriously, unless they are exceedingly prudent. It is
not, therefore, quite a perfect paradise. And there
are many days when the clouds seem to come down
upon the mountains, and the thick mists roll up from
the valleys to meet the clouds, and you cannot see
your next neighbour’s house, or even the trees of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>your own garden. Then, too, the rain descends
furiously, and rattles upon the wooden or corrugated
iron roofs of the houses with a deafening noise. A
flash of lightning dazzles your eyes, and the sharp crack
like a pistol-shot tells you how near to you it passed,
followed by an awful crash of thunder, which echoes
and reechoes from every neighbouring mountain and
valley. In such a scene as this, you may perceive, if
a lucid interval permits it, the Member of Council
riding home from a meeting at the Viceroy’s residence,
looking like a bathing-machine man, and caparisoned
from head to foot in drenched waterproof garments.
Riding, however, is an exercise not always congenial
to the age of a Member of Council; and in this case
he has to be carried in a sort of sedan-chair, locally
known as a <em>jhompon</em>, with which four or more hill-men
toil along, groaning and grunting and perspiring,
partly from the weight of their burthen, and partly from
the heat of the coarse but bright-coloured clothes
which they wear as their master’s livery. There is a
sort of grim satisfaction in seeing the sleek Member
of Council exposed to some discomfort from the
weather, as he <em>must</em> go to his Council meeting, whatever
the state of the weather may be. This, however,
fortunately for him, happens only about once a week.
On other days he is master of the situation, and can
sit over his fireside, with his office-boxes round him,
regardless of the elements. If the weather is fine, he
will walk out on the Mall, with his pony or <em>jhompon</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>in attendance, and escorted by one or more of his
scarlet-coated satellites. He may loiter about his
garden, or he may look on at a lawn-tennis party, or
he may go so far as to have a party for lawn-tennis
at his own house. But even at Simla the Member
of Council is not much given to hospitality. It was
said of a certain legislative member, who shall be
nameless (and it is now an old tale), that the smoke
was never seen to come out of his kitchen-chimney
after his own frugal mid-day meal had been prepared.
There is, perhaps, something to be said on behalf of
the Legislative Member, as he is usually an elderly
barrister of great but previously unappreciated ability,
who is sent out to India by some political friend to
make what money and reputation he can in the five
years for which his appointment lasts. There have
been brilliant exceptions to this rule within the last
half-century, but we need not dwell upon these details.
We regret to have to come to the conclusion, speaking
broadly, that the Member of Council, whether it be
at Simla or Calcutta, is too frequently a social failure,
and, as has been already imperfectly suggested, sometimes
almost an official nonentity, or at the best a sort
of political paradox.</p>

<p class='c010'>It might perhaps have been more correct, according
to the official table of precedence, to have given
priority of mention to the Governors and Lieutenant-Governors
of Provinces. But for the present we will
consider that the Governors of Madras and Bombay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>are, after their kind, though less in degree, analogous
in their own kingdoms to the Viceroy. The Lieutenant-Governors
of provinces, on the other hand, stand out
with a stronger sense of personality, and in the case
of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal the position
becomes more accentuated, partly from the vast importance
of the charge, and partly from the more immediate
contact in which the Lieutenant-Governor is
placed as regards the Viceroy when the latter is in
residence in Calcutta.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may be new to some people to be told that in
Calcutta there are at times no less than five “Lord
Sahebs,” as the natives call them. There is the
great Lord Saheb, <em>i.e.</em> H.E. the Viceroy. There is
the little Lord Saheb, <em>i.e.</em> the Lieutenant-Governor
of Bengal. There is the Lord Saheb of Calcutta—at
least, that was the title in use when Sir Stuart
Hogg was Lord Mayor of Calcutta. There are also
the Military Lord Saheb or Commander-in-Chief, and
the Lord Padre Saheb, <em>i.e.</em> the Bishop. But of all
these several lords it turns out that the little lord,
<em>i.e.</em> the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, is of most
importance, at least for social purposes, in the eyes
of the Calcutta community. The Lieutenant-Governor
of Bengal, since the creation of the appointment in
1853–54, has always been a distinguished member of
the local Civil Service, with two notable exceptions—when
the political and personal connections of Sir
George Campbell and Sir Richard Temple caused them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>to be foisted on a province with which they had little
or no previous official connection.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal rules over a
kingdom containing so many thousands of square miles,
and so many millions of people, that no person of
reasonable intellectual capacity ever tries to recollect
the actual figures. His dominions are not quite so
extensive as the British realms, on which it is said
that the sun never sets; but the sun gets up a long
time earlier in the eastern portion of the Bengal
province than it does in the western portion of it, so
huge is the extent of the territory. As to the millions
of people, it is more easy to talk or write of them
than to form a correct conception of them. You may
understand that there are probably a million of mites
round a well-kept cheese. But there are nearly fifty
districts, or cheeses, each with its million of mites,
under the care and custody of the Lieutenant-Governor
of Bengal, and even this estimate inadequately represents
the full number of his subjects. And yet, if it
can be believed, there is not one of these many
million mites who is not able and authorised to
represent to the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal any
personal grievance or injustice from which this individual
mite believes himself to be suffering. And, as
a fact, not a day passes on which considerable numbers
of these mites do not address the Lieutenant-Governor
directly by letter, representing their personal wants and
grievances. In a large number of their cases an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>inquiry is made by the Lieutenant-Governor to ascertain
if the grievance is real, and if it has not already
received due attention from the proper authorities; or
the complainant is put in communication with the
local officers who are competent to deal in the first
instance with the subject of his grievance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal does not, however,
always repose upon a bed of roses, and the head
that wears a crown usually finds some thorns in it. However,
let us consider the good side as well as the
less favourable side of the case. The Lieutenant-Governor
has a salary of £10,000 a year to begin
with, and he has also the privilege of making a
monthly contingent bill, as it is called, in which
certain items vaguely called sumptuary expenses are
charged upon the public revenues. He has a private
secretary and one or more A.D.C.’s at his disposal, and
occasionally a special physician to look after his health. He
is provided with two official residences—one called
“Belvedere,” in the neighbourhood of Calcutta, and
the other called “The Shrubbery,” in the mountain
station of Darjeling. He has a splendid yacht or
state barge at his disposal, in which he can traverse the
rivers that intersect his dominions, where railways and
ordinary roads do not provide the means of communication.
He has his special trains and state carriages
on the railways. He has an escort of irregular cavalry
whenever he takes his walks, or rides, or his carriage-drives,
abroad; and his gates are guarded by sentries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>both native soldiers and policemen. His scarlet-coated
satellites are only less numerous than those which may
be seen on the Viceroy’s establishment. In short,
though he is called the little lord, in contrast with the
great lord or Viceroy, he is so much alike in all his
surroundings that Pompey is very like Cæsar, and
Cæsar is very like Pompey, but particularly Pompey.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal may be said to
be the permanent head of the social system in
Calcutta. It is to him that the native community
especially look as the fountain of honour, and as the
dispenser of patronage in his province. Nor are the
European portion of the public by any means backward
in seeking His Honour’s favour and patronage
on behalf of themselves and their young friends and
relations who are sent out to India to find a livelihood.
It is a fact that there is hardly a member of Her
Majesty’s Government or of Her Majesty’s Opposition
who has not an application lying before the Lieutenant-Governor
for an appointment to be given to some
connection or acquaintance. If such applications come
all the way from England, it may be imagined how
much more numerous they must be from those persons
who live in India, and have more or less a personal
acquaintance with the Lieutenant-Governor’s existence.
For every appointment that he bestows he has the
satisfaction of knowing that the old proverb is true,
and that whilst the successful candidate is probably
ungrateful, there are at least nine other disappointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>men who henceforth look upon the Lieutenant-Governor
as an enemy. It must not be supposed that
the Lieutenant-Governor is unprotected against the
swarm of applicants for places and patronage. He has
his official secretaries and his private secretaries to
guard the outworks, and with good reason “<i><span lang="la">difficiles
aditus primos habet</span></i>.” The inexperienced applicant
may be baffled in many ways. He may be informed
that he has not applied through the proper channel.
He has knocked at the private door when he ought to
have gone to the official gateway. If he succeeds in
effecting an entrance, and in obtaining an interview
with the private secretary, he is met with courteous
words, but he must be very fortunate or very strongly
backed up if he is permitted to get a glimpse of the
Lieutenant-Governor. He is requested to leave his
papers and his address, and to await an answer. The
young man departs, feeling confident that he has
effected a lodgment, and that he has created a favourable
impression, and so he goes away with a light
heart. He little knows that as soon as his back is
turned, the private secretary, in an unimpassioned and
business-like manner, passes on the papers to a clerk,
with an order, “Give this gentleman our No. 1 form.”
There are three or four stereotyped forms of letter in
the private secretary’s office ready for issue to all
candidates. When a neatly-written letter in a fine
official cover stamped “On Her Majesty’s Service,”
reaches the candidate’s address, he finds, not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>appointment which he coveted, but an intimation that
his name will be inserted in the list of candidates for
it, and that the Lieutenant-Governor regrets that he
can hold out no immediate hopes, &#38;c. &#38;c. There is
sometimes an unfortunate person who treasures a letter
of this kind, and is weak enough after a short interval
to pay a further visit to the private secretary. The
result is that he receives a letter in “our form No. 2,”
expressing the Lieutenant-Governor’s further regret
or surprise at his impatience. If he still persists in
his visits, he will eventually receive “our form No. 3,”
in which he is informed that the Lieutenant-Governor
must decline to see him or to make any further communication
to him, and then at last, perhaps, his eyes
are opened, and he may go so far as to blame himself
for having given the Lieutenant-Governor so much
trouble, when in reality the Lieutenant-Governor has,
perhaps, heard little more of him than his name.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there is another class of applicants for appointments
and promotion who cannot be disposed of quite
so easily. The members of the sacred Civil Service, of
which caste the Lieutenant-Governor is himself the
chief, are accustomed to think that it is their special
privilege, and a duty to themselves, to represent to the
Lieutenant-Governor their own claims and their own
peculiar fitness for any desirable appointment that is
vacant, or likely to become vacant, for many of them
are not at all content to wait till the vacancy actually
occurs. The Lieutenant-Governor usually submits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>himself to the ordeal of seeing these candidates, and
though it is often a sad waste of his time, it is not
always without its uses, for it sometimes enables him to
obtain a closer insight into the character of the applicant,
and at the same time to pick up some information
about local affairs under a new light. Sometimes the
Lieutenant-Governor has a plan of admitting visitors of
this class to breakfast, and it becomes an interesting
speculation for him during breakfast to guess with
what particular object each individual has come. This
arrangement has also occasionally the happy effect of
disconcerting the visitors themselves. Mr. Smith, who
has arrived from some remote part of the country especially
to urge his claims to some particular appointment,
finds, to his disgust and amazement, that Mr. Robinson,
the very man whose rivalry he most feared, has also
come down from his district obviously with the same
intention. In such a case the Lieutenant-Governor has
great opportunities, if he is master of the conversation
at his breakfast-table, of operating on the feelings of
Smith and Robinson whilst the rest of the company
are present. When breakfast is over, the Lieutenant-Governor
usually retires to his study, and the visitors
who wish for a private interview wait on till their turn
comes to be ushered into the great man’s presence. We
will draw a veil over the scenes which there occur. It
is curious to note how strongly the wish is father to
the thought, and how each candidate, if cross-examined
immediately on his exit from his interview, will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>found to have put the construction most favourable to
his own desires on the words uttered by the Lieutenant-Governor.
Happy is the Lieutenant-Governor who is
able to express his meaning clearly and decisively, and
at the same time not to wound the susceptibilities of
his visitor. But unless the desired appointment has
already been promised to another man, it seldom happens
that the candidate is willing to persuade himself
that he has no chance of success, however kindly and
courteously the Lieutenant-Governor may have tried to
make this clear to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>We will pass on to another phase of the Lieutenant-Governor’s
social influences. As the head of society he
is bound to give what are called entertainments—which
may be sub-divided into balls, at homes, dinner parties,
garden-parties, breakfast parties, picnics, &#38;c. The
house called Belvedere, which is the Lieutenant-Governor’s
official residence at Calcutta, is a large
straggling edifice, having been built from somewhat
small beginnings until the additions have almost entirely
superseded the original structure. It is, unfortunately,
wrongly placed to the wind as regards the
reception rooms, and although the south verandahs are
delightfully cool when there is a southerly breeze, the
suite of the drawing-room and dining-room and ball-room
runs from north to south, and is badly ventilated,
so that the heat becomes excessive whenever the rooms
are crowded for a ball or any other large party. Each
Lieutenant-Governor has added to and altered the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>building, so that its capacity has increased in greater
proportion than its architectural beauty; and yet it
still remains for another Lieutenant-Governor to devise
an entrance-hall worthy of the rest of the building.
But on the occasion of the state balls which the
Lieutenant-Governor gives on several suitable dates,
there is certainly a very brilliant <i><span lang="fr">coup d’œil</span></i> as one
looks through the long vista of the rooms thrown open
for dancing; and he must be indeed a cynic who cannot
enjoy the cool breeze in the south verandah, or the
comfortable arrangements on the grand and semi-lighted
stone staircase which leads down to the lawn, and to
the large pavilions in which supper is sometimes provided,
when the time of the year permits. If you are
young, and if you have a heart still at liberty, you
cannot do better than try and lose it amidst the scented
shrubs and plants which surround the cool recesses
and sheltered seats so considerately provided for blushing
maidens and whispering lovers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps some of the most successful entertainments
at Belvedere of late years have been the garden-parties
held in the afternoon, to which the native nobility and
the most influential and wealthy among the Hindoos,
Mahomedans, Parsees, Moguls, Burmese, and every
other Eastern nationality are invited, in common with
all the English ladies and gentlemen of Calcutta. The
mixture of Oriental and European costume produces
the happiest effect, and exhibits a picturesque scene
which could hardly be matched elsewhere. Native
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>gentlemen are rather shy and sensitive, and are always
more or less afraid, especially inside a house, of compromising
themselves or being somehow compromised,
owing to the machinations of the native servants, by
contact with some European arrangements of cooking,
or other things which are objectionable according to
their ideas. But in an open-air garden-party they can
wander about without any fear of meeting anything
that may be offensive to their caste prejudices. It is
much to be regretted that, however well-acquainted he
may think himself to be with native habits and feelings,
it is almost impossible for an English gentleman
to be quite sure that there may not be something in
his entertainment for the gratification of native gentlemen
which, thanks probably to his own servants, may
not be misinterpreted or misunderstood by some of
them. But, be this as it may, it is rather difficult for
the most fastidious native gentleman to take offence
when walking up and down the smooth lawns at
Belvedere; and if he diverts his course to seek the
tea-tables or the other refreshment tents, he can hardly
have anyone but himself to blame. It is very seldom
that a Hindoo gentleman takes any refreshment, but
some of the Mahomedans occasionally indulge in an
ice or a cup of tea. It is very unusual for any native
ladies to appear at these garden-parties. There are a
few Christian convert ladies who come to them, wearing
a sort of English costume, which is, unfortunately,
not very becoming to them. Some of the native
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>gentlemen bring their pretty grand-children with them,
as has been mentioned in the previous chapter. But the
time has not yet come for a native gentleman to bring
his wife out on such occasions, although it is noticeable
that a native gentleman is usually very willing to be
introduced to the English ladies and to shake hands
with them. The native gentlemen attach much importance
to the shaking of hands, though it is a custom
not originally recognised under their own native codes
of etiquette. The time is by no means remote when
more than one native nobleman of high caste used
promptly to wash his hands after shaking hands with
an English gentleman, one of his retinue carrying a
gold basin and a supply of water to enable his master
to get rid of the pollution of the touch of the white
man’s hand. But we have been informed that one of
the last native noblemen who adopted this practice was
cured of it by a sensible Englishman, who, on his part,
also produced a servant with a basin and water, and
deliberately proceeded to wash his hands in the native
nobleman’s presence. But we must return from this
digression, and make our parting bow to the Lieutenant-Governor
as we retire with the rest of the gay
crowd.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has been mentioned that the Lieutenant-Governor
of Bengal has an official residence at the mountain
station of Darjeling. Thirty years ago it was no easy
task to reach Darjeling, and in 1857 the Lieutenant-Governor
marched up from Calcutta to the foot of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>hills with a regular camp, at the rate of about ten
miles a day, and the march occupied fully six weeks.
But now the railway has altered all this. The Lieutenant-Governor
gets into his special train at Calcutta
at 4 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> on Monday, and by noon on Tuesday he finds
himself safely in his mountain residence at Darjeling.
A steam tramway now runs right up the mountains,
and thus Darjeling is much more accessible than
Simla, which is not yet provided with a similar tramway.
The principal drawbacks to Darjeling are the
heavy rain and the dense mists, which too frequently
envelop the whole of the mountain ranges. But when
there is a clear and bright day, the view of the everlasting
snows, with the mighty Kinchenjunga in all its
majesty, is grand and glorious beyond all description.
It is, however, rather the fashion for the Lieutenant-Governor
and his secretaries, and the other great
officials who follow in his train to Darjeling, to make
themselves out to be great martyrs to colds and coughs
and neuralgia and other maladies, which they attribute
to the cold and damp and misty climate of the hills.
It seems rather strange that if they dislike the climate
so much they should take the trouble to go to Darjeling.
But these grumblings are really only lip-deep,
and they know very well that it is much more comfortable
to sleep in a cool room, with a cheerful fire in it,
than to remain down in the plains with the thermometer
at 80, and to have to court sleep under the
influence of a punkah—which has to be pulled by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>native who is unpleasantly prone to go to sleep, and
so to cease pulling the punkah.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, when the rain is heaviest at Darjeling, in
July or August, the Lieutenant-Governor and the
principal grumblers of his suite take the opportunity
to descend to the plains, as this is the time when the
Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal can most conveniently
proceed on a tour in his state yacht, or barge, to visit
some of the remote portions of his province, which are
not easily accessible except by water. The state yacht
is built something in the shape and style of the Lord
Mayor’s barge, or one of the house-boats now so
common on the Thames, only it is much larger, and it
is fitted up with everything that is needed to make it
tolerably cool and comfortable, for the temperature
in the shade in the rainy season is generally about 80°
in Bengal. The yacht is towed by a powerful steamer,
and all the cooking is carried on in the steamer, which
also conveys all the native servants and official clerks,
and the horses and ponies which usually accompany
the Lieutenant-Governor on tour. When the yacht
is under steam, and going along at about ten or
twelve miles an hour, it is exceedingly pleasant to
sit on the well-sheltered deck and enjoy the cool
breeze. The cabins are all fitted up with punkahs,
so that those who have to sit and work in their cabins
are duly cared for. The scenery on the rivers is not
often very attractive, and as the greater part of the
country on both sides of the river is under water, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>view may be said to be decidedly monotonous. But,
however pleasant and cool it may be during the day,
and whilst the yacht is in motion, it is when darkness
comes on, and it is time to anchor, that the unpleasant
heat begins to assert itself; especially if the wind
drops, or is shut off by some inconvenient village on
the bank of the river. As soon as the lamps are
lighted, it often happens that a plague of insects comes
on board, either moths, or odoriferous bugs, or flying
earwigs, or an army of large grasshoppers. It is
wonderful to what a distance these insects come off
from the shore as soon as they see the bright lights
of the yacht. Fortunately, the dining-saloon is
guarded with wire-gauze blinds, so that it is possible
to exclude these pests at dinner-time, otherwise the
Lieutenant-Governor would have to dine by daylight,
which is the custom for ordinary mortals on board
the river-steamers and boats.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Lieutenant-Governor’s yacht arrives at a
civil station or large town, it is a day of great excitement
for the inhabitants of all classes and degrees.
The principal officials present themselves on board the
yacht, and take the Lieutenant-Governor’s orders on
the programme which they have devised for his entertainment.
It is the correct thing for the Lieutenant-Governor
to go and inspect all the Government offices
and the local jail. There is a sort of mania for inspecting
jails, and if there is a local lunatic asylum it is
sure to hold a high place in the programme. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>inspection of the Government offices is usually a
solemn mockery. Most officers of any tact understand
the meaning of eye-wash, and everything is externally
furbished up so as to look its best. The Lieutenant-Governor
is only human, and in reality sees very
little below the surface of that which is exhibited to
him. If the Lieutenant-Governor is known to be of
a cantankerous disposition, as has, unfortunately, been
the case sometimes, the proper thing to be done is to
lay traps for him, and to present to his eyes something
which will at once give him offence; such, for instance,
as a treasure-chest with a broken hinge, or a large
bundle of old papers all worm-eaten and almost
illegible. He will at once fly at these objects, so
shocking to his sense of official propriety, and whilst
he is fiercely hunting the foxes which have been thus
turned out, he will pass blindly by a dozen other
things which might really have been worthy of his
notice. With an intelligent and kindly Lieutenant-Governor,
who understands his business, it is equally
safe to proceed on an entirely different plan, and to
point out to him the defects and the wants of the
place with the full knowledge that he will make due
allowance for them. No sensible Lieutenant-Governor
is over-anxious to find fault, or to bring discredit on
the local officers, who are obviously doing their little
best, as he well knows by the recollection of his own
experiences in a similar position. It is often a matter
of great convenience if the occasion of the Lieutenant-Governor’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>visit can be seized, either to lay the foundation
stone of some new public building, or to
celebrate the completion and opening of some new institution
or work of public utility, such as water-works,
or a new bridge or hospital. This affords an opportunity
for the presentation of an appropriate address,
in which the usual platitudes about the development
of municipal institutions and the recognition of the
capacity of natives for self-government must find their
proper place and expression. The richest and most
influential native subscribers to the work are then
introduced, and on receiving a few kindly words from
the Lieutenant-Governor’s lips they feel at once certain
that they will shortly find themselves authorised in
the <cite>Government Gazette</cite> to style themselves C.S.I. or
C.I.E., unless a native title is more consonant to their
feelings. The principal official of the station then
entertains the Lieutenant-Governor and his party at
dinner, unless the Lieutenant-Governor takes the
precaution to ask all the principal residents to dine on
board his yacht, which is by far the safest course for
him to adopt. If the Lieutenant-Governor has not a
good cook, good food, and good wine with him in his
yacht, he is not fit to be Lieutenant-Governor. For
in a remote district the best and most liberal local
official may have but an indifferent cook, who, perhaps,
takes the opportunity to get drunk; and the
local supplies of food and wine and ice may not be
of the very best quality. Therefore, a Lieutenant-Governor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>with due respect for his own health and
comfort, does well to invite the local people to dine
with him in his yacht, instead of going on shore to
dine with them. And after dinner the broad deck of the
yacht affords an excellent space for an evening party,
to which the Lieutenant-Governor can ask all the
other local residents, and especially all the native
gentlemen who do not care to be invited to dinner.
Probably some wealthy native gentlemen illuminate
their houses, or get up a display of fireworks on the
river-banks near the yacht; and this counts, in the
eyes of the assembled crowds, as part of the evening’s
entertainment. And so the night wears on, and by
the time that the last guest has gone on shore the
Lieutenant-Governor has long been slumbering peacefully
in his cabin; and the next day, as soon as the
rosy-fingered dawn appears, the anchor is weighed, and
the steamer and yacht proceed on their journey to
some other station, where the Lieutenant-Governor
will have again to go through the same kind of business
as that which we have attempted to describe.
So we will now bid him farewell.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='c009'>ENGLISH COLONISTS IN BENGAL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Hitherto we have written of “kings and tetrarchs and
all great things” in India. Now let us go to a different
degree in the social scale, to those who were alluded to
as the real colonists of India in the first of these chapters.
There are now hundreds, or rather thousands, of our
countrymen settled in India who may be taken as representing
the middle-classes of England; though it might
be more correct to use the public-school term, the
“upper-middle” classes. Some of these are employed
in the cultivation and manufacture of indigo, or sugar,
or jute, or other mercantile produce, in the hot and
steamy plains of Bengal. Others, who are engaged in
the management of tea gardens, occupy hilly tracts,
many of which are as hot and steamy as the plains;
though some tea is grown at high altitudes, and in a
comparatively cooler climate, as on the mountain-slopes
around Darjeling. Others are employed in managing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>and working the railways which now traverse the length
and breadth of the country, and for these there is no
escape from all the perils and vicissitudes of the greatest
heat. In most of the large towns throughout the
country there are established firms of merchants, of
which some of the partners are constantly flitting
backwards and forwards between India and England,
though there is always some local representative of the
name and business of the firm left in India. Amongst
the trading or shop-keeping classes there are some who
have their branch “establishments” at the great hill
stations, such as Simla, to which they migrate in order
to escape from the heat of the plains when the Court
and fashion of the capital retire there with a similar
object.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under the name of colonists we may readily give the
first place to those who are engaged in the cultivation
and manufacture of indigo. Owing to circumstances to
which we need not further allude, the indigo-planters
have not fared well in recent times, especially in some
parts of the country, where, to put the case simply, it
was no longer possible to grow indigo at a profit, so
that the business must have come to an end of itself
without the mischievous meddling of agitators, or the
irritating intervention of prejudiced Government officials.
But there are still many parts of the country, especially
in the province of Behar, where indigo may be cultivated
successfully; and if the season is favourable, and
the crop good, and the London market-price satisfactory,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>a handsome profit may be made. There are
some few indigo-factories or “concerns” which may
almost always be trusted year after year to yield a good
and profitable out-turn. But it is not by any means a
general rule to be so prosperous. At some places
either too heavy rain or too little rain may spoil the
growing crop. A neighbouring river may overflow its
banks and drown all the hopes of the husbandmen, or
the much-needed water may refuse to appear in the
river at the proper time, so that the well-grown plant
cannot be manufactured into the dye. These are but a
few out of the many troubles that attend the cultivation
of indigo. There are some years when the life of the
indigo-planter is a life of mere agony and anxiety, and
nothing that his skill or experience can suggest or
devise is of the slightest avail to ward off the impending
ruin of his crop and of his hopes for a successful
season.</p>

<p class='c010'>But for all this, the life of an indigo-planter is generally
healthy and happy, and at all events it is more
suited to the taste and disposition of most young
Englishmen than the dull routine of a merchant’s
office or a bank. Let us try to picture to ourselves
the buildings and surroundings of the indigo-planter’s
home. There is a cheerful and substantial house nestling
in the shelter of some fine trees; there is a broad
lawn, and a flower-garden full of roses and myrtles
and variegated flowering shrubs. There is the well-stocked
kitchen-garden with its constant supplies of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>English vegetables. There are the stables and coachhouses
which we may presently inspect. There are the
poultry-yards, where no small flock of fowls and ducks
and geese and turkeys will be found. The rabbithutches
are not neglected, and the pigeon-house literally
swarms with pigeons. The sleek milch-cows, with their
calves, have their appointed places; and you may be
sure that there are good kennels for the dogs. A little
apart from the dwelling-house the factory-buildings
will usually be found, with the vats and apparatus for
steeping and pressing the indigo to extract the dye,
and the boiling-house with its tall and ugly chimney,
and the drying-houses where the cakes of indigo are
kept until it is time to pack and despatch them to
Calcutta for sale. All the factory-buildings usually
stand in one <em>compound</em>, as the local term goes, and this
is in size almost equal to a small park, surrounded by
a high grassy bank or fence to keep off trespassers, and
usually studded with some fine groups of trees, in the
shade of which the cattle take shelter from the mid-day
heat. The English colonist is ever anxious to keep up
the appearance of a comfortable English home, and not
merely the appearance but the solid substance, so far as
the difference of climate permits.</p>

<p class='c010'>An indigo factory is usually managed by one of the
owners or partners in the concern. Let us take the
case of a healthy hardy man a little past thirty years
of age, who has served an apprenticeship of several
years as an assistant in the factory of which he at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>length stands forth as manager. He has acquired a
certain share as part-owner in the factory, and will
thus earn his quota in the profits of the season, whilst
he has a separate fixed salary and sundry emoluments
in his special capacity as manager. His position is
thoroughly independent, if so be that he and his
partners have sufficient capital of their own to carry on
the expenditure of the concern. If they have not the
requisite capital, their agents in Calcutta finance
the concern, making such advances as are needed for
the purchase of seed, the cost of cultivation, payment
of rents, and all the other expenses which must be
provided for until the produce of the season can be
sold and brought to account. The profitable condition
of an indigo factory depends chiefly on the capacity
of the owners to provide their own funds, or on their
having to borrow them. For as the cultivation is
precarious, and the amount of the produce varies from
year to year, money cannot be borrowed on such
security except at a heavy charge for interest. With
commission and other charges the borrower has to pay
about twenty per cent. for the capital which he
borrows. Of course, it makes a very great difference
at the end of the season if twenty per cent. has to be
deducted from the net profits of the concern.</p>

<p class='c010'>At certain times of the year the indigo-planter has
rather a hard-worked life. In what may be termed
the spring-time, when the plant is growing, he must
be up with the dawn for a long ride through the fields
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>to see that the cultivators are looking properly after
their work. The hot and blazing sun rises, but he
heeds it little, as his anxious eyes are bent on noting
any changes for good or bad that may have occurred
in the crop since he last rode in this direction. He
does not, however, disdain the shelter of a friendly
tree, if so be that his course is arrested by a party of
anxious villagers who seek his advice or orders about
the right to use some water for irrigation, or to fish in
some particular pond, or to settle some minute question
of caste—such, for instance, as the grave question
whether some new arrival is entitled to be shaved by
the village barber. I have sat for more than an hour
with a planter listening to all the earnest arguments
submitted for his decision on this point. Sometimes
also, his ride may be interrupted by less peaceable
demonstrations, for an aggressive neighbour may have
trespassed on his cultivated lands, or he may find a
hostile force arrayed to prevent him from ploughing
certain fields to which he considers himself entitled.
Fortunately the stand-up fights of armed retainers,
which were not uncommon years ago, are now almost
unknown, and those who are wisest in their generation
now are careful to avoid any recourse to force in
settling their disputes with their neighbours. At
length the morning round is finished, and he gallops
home through the fiery sunshine, giving his horse the
benefit of a little practice at a few jumps over any
banks and ditches that lie conveniently in his path.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>As he rides up to his house the children and the
“<span lang="la">placens uxor</span>” appear, probably to chide him for
being so late out in the hot sun, as it seems to be the
first duty of a good wife always to remind her husband
that he ought to take more care of himself. Probably,
however, the lady is anxious for her breakfast; whilst
the children, who have had their breakfast, are only
too glad to welcome their father and to follow him
into his dressing-room to have their little talk with
him, and to watch all the mysterious operations of
dressing which seem to have such a fascination for
children. In India each little child of two or three
years old has its own special man or boy servant in
charge of it, so that the children can be still cared for
in their father’s dressing-room, which might be not
quite so convenient in England, where children are in
charge of nurses. But when their father has bathed
and dressed, the children lead him out into the
breakfast-room, and, probably having got some spoil
from the breakfast-table, they retire to their mid-day
slumbers and are seen no more.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mid-day breakfast at a factory is usually one of
the most pleasant hours of the day. The friends who
are staying in the house, for planters are very hospitable,
and any neighbours (neighbours meaning
people living within twenty miles) who have come over
for a morning visit, all present themselves at the well-decked
table. It is hardly necessary to say that
breakfast at 12 o’clock indicates that there is to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>no lunch at 1 or 2 o’clock, and it is, in fact, breakfast
and lunch combined. Therefore, the dishes are
both numerous and serious; and as the sun is over
the yard-arm, in nautical phrase, the men have fully
earned their right to a draught of cool beer, or of
claret or hock with such combinations of soda and iced
materials as the heart desires. When a man has been
in the saddle for several hours with a fine blazing
sun overhead, and the temperature almost beyond the
thermometer’s power of measurement, it is not
astonishing that a good pull at a tankard of beer is
something like a fabulous draught of nectar. It is a
sort of medical axiom that as long as a man can take
plenty of outdoor exercise in India, he can drink as
much beer as is good for him; and <em>vice versâ</em>, if he
wishes to drink beer he must be careful to take plenty
of exercise. But to some constitutions beer is always
hostile, and so they must have recourse to claret, or
hock, or burgundy; or it may be brandy and soda, but
this is always to be shunned as much as possible.
However, breakfast must come to an end; and when
the ladies of the house retire to the drawing-room, the
men usually take their arm-chairs and a pipe, and not
unfrequently the conversation gradually drops, until
they have all quietly passed off into a gentle doze,
which is nature’s best restorer at this hour of the day.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it is not to be supposed that the planter’s work
is now at an end. He must rouse himself after forty
winks, and go off to his cutcherry or office, where he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>must pass a few hours in company with his native
clerks and subordinates. His work is usually interesting
and diversified. He must look to his letters from
his Calcutta agents, who want to be kept well posted
up as to the prospects of the coming crop, and the
various heads of expenditure for which money has to
be provided. There are communications more or less
friendly or unfriendly from the district officials in
whose courts civil or criminal suits are pending on
behalf of or against people connected with the factory.
However peaceably disposed a planter may be, some
of his neighbours or some of his own people are sure
to bring him before the courts in some way. He may
have to receive a visit from his wealthy native neighbour,
who has come with sweet words in his mouth,
but whose heart is full of bitterness and war. He
must listen to the complaints of his own people, and
he must sometimes minister to their physical complaints
also, though at most large factories a regular
medical establishment is maintained to provide for
those who are sick or suffering from accidental
injuries. As a matter of fact, also, an influential
planter administers justice in a quiet way among his
own people, and prevents them, if he can, from taking
their petty quarrels and disputes into the Government
courts, where the expenses of litigation are often
almost ruinous to the poorer classes. And thus it
comes to pass that the planter finds plenty of occupation
in his office for several hours in the afternoon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>and he is only too glad when he receives a message
from his wife to say that the carriages and horses are
ready for the evening drive, or that he is expected to
come forth to take his part in a game of polo or
lawn-tennis.</p>

<p class='c010'>Planters are always hospitable. In India it is a sort
of maxim still that the guest confers the favour, for,
of course, the guest is really very welcome when your
nearest neighbour lives five miles from you. And so
each planter gathers round him from time to time a
little party of visitors and neighbours, and when the
men are sufficiently numerous they get up a game of
polo. Perhaps the best social game that was ever
invented for India was Badminton, which has now
been almost superseded by lawn-tennis. Badminton
has never been much appreciated in England; but in
India the absence of high wind and rain was much
in its favour, and there were many ladies who played
it almost as well as men. For, as was well said by a
learned judge, men and women are almost on an
equality as regards the upper part of their dress, and
can use their hands and heads with nearly equal effect.
But when a lawn-tennis ball makes a bound into the
skirts of a lady’s dress she has not the same facility
of escaping from it as her male adversary. Therefore,
as the shuttlecock of Badminton was always
flying high, and from head to head, so to speak, Badminton
for a long time in India held its own against the
introduction of lawn-tennis; though the day has come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>now when lawn-tennis has ousted its old opponent,
and both ladies and men look forward to their game of
lawn-tennis as soon as it is possible to find a court
sheltered sufficiently by shady trees against the rays of
the declining sun. The temperature may be above
80°, but, nevertheless, bright-faced and neatly-dressed
girls come out arrayed for the combat, and thinking
little of the heat and the fatigue if they can only get
good partners and a good game. Those who are
accustomed to judge of Indian ladies only from their
pale and worn countenances when they return invalided
to England, would hardly believe with what vigour and
spirit the same ladies played lawn-tennis in India as
long as their health and strength lasted.</p>

<p class='c010'>When darkness puts an end to the play there is no
lack of refreshment suited to the taste of each sex,
and there are some men who are so selfish that they
do not scruple to light their cigars and pipes in the
presence of the ladies, but it is to be regretted that
the good old fashion has passed away when no man
smoked in the presence of a lady. Certainly the men
have plenty of advantages special to themselves. For
instance, when the ladies have to go into the house to
prepare for dinner and change their dresses, the men
usually adjourn to the swimming-bath. At many large
factories there is a fine swimming-bath in a house
built for the purpose, from 50 to 70 feet long, and
more than half as wide. One of the greatest pleasures
of which the human body is capable is to plunge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>hissing-hot into the clear and cool water of the bath,
and to swim a few lazy strokes to the nearest resting-place.
There used to be a medical myth, that it was
dangerous for a man to bathe when very hot. But
later and wiser doctors have discovered the error, and
very grateful we should be for their discovery. To
those who have learnt at Eton, or elsewhere, to take a
good “header” we can recommend no more exquisite
sensation than that which they will derive from
plunging red hot into the cool water of a swimming-bath.</p>

<p class='c010'>There may be more splendid entertainments elsewhere,
but there are few more sociable and pleasant
dinner-parties than those which crown the labours of
the day at a good indigo factory. The ladies are not
often quite equal in number to the men; but that is a
fault on the right side so far as they are concerned, as
they will receive all the more attention, whilst there
are always one or more greedy or hungry men who
are more inclined to devote themselves to the substance
of their dinner than to the pleasures of conversation;
nor are they absolutely in the wrong. The dishes may
be simple, but they are sure to be good. Who does
not remember the saddle of mutton from a sheep
reared and carefully fed in the farm up to its fourth
year? Neither the downs of Sussex nor the hills of
Wales produce more delicate and well-flavoured meat.
What is there to be compared with the whiteness and
tenderness of the well-boiled capon, the last fortnight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>of whose life has been the subject of the most careful
feeding, as he passed, day by day, through the separate
compartments of the fattening range until he was promoted
to the condemned cell at the head of the range?
Capons should, of course, be well fed always, but for
the last fortnight they should be taken up and fed
most delicately in a fattening range specially constructed
with fourteen or fifteen compartments with
sliding panels between them, so that those who are
being thus treated for about a fortnight, find themselves
promoted day by day towards the highest compartment,
a condemned cell, from which there is no
promotion except to the kitchen. We cannot stop to
enumerate all the fine vegetables, such as the potatoes
which have been grown in a soil prepared with the refuse
stalks of the indigo plant, which is most congenial to
them, so that no better potatoes ever came out of
Ireland. There are champion peas from Sutton’s best
seed. There is celery equal to the best that England
can exhibit. We will not even notice the better kinds
of Indian vegetables; but the dinner is by no means
a dinner of herbs, and those who have come to it with
good appetite and good digestion are not likely to go
empty away. Early hours are the rule at a factory,
and when the men have joined the ladies in the drawing-room
a little music may sometimes be supplemented
by a little dancing; but as a rule most of the
party are not unwilling to seek their bed-rooms, with
the knowledge that they have to rise on the morrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>with the early dawn, either for the renewal of their
daily labour or to return to their own houses.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Doubtless there can scarcely be a more enjoyable
life than that of a successful and healthy indigo-planter.
But there must be at times a darker side to the picture.
Illness may break out suddenly, and before any skilled
medical aid can arrive the hand of death may have
robbed the household of one of its darlings. We all
know with what fearful rapidity cholera seizes on its
victims, and when once cholera has marked a house
it is seldom content with only one victim. Some of
the numerous domestic servants are almost sure to
take alarm, and to frighten themselves into the belief
that they must die. It is an anxious and awful time.
Nor are other minor dangers and alarms wanting.
In some factories it is almost impossible to keep cobras
and other dangerous snakes from coming into the
house; and many a parent has found a deadly cobra
in painful proximity to the pillow of a child sleeping
happily unconscious of its danger, but liable to put
itself in peril by the slightest movement. Or, whilst
the master is still out on his morning rounds, the
affrighted servants rush to their mistress with the
news that a mad dog or a mad jackal is running about
the garden, and has attacked and scared the gardeners.
But it is useless to multiply instances. Fortunately,
the larger animals of prey are no longer to be found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>in the district in which indigo is cultivated; but in the
tea gardens, which are in the wilder and more jungly
parts of the country, even a tiger is an occasional
visitor, and leopards are constantly on the watch to
carry off a pet dog, or a goat, or a calf from almost
under the eyes of the planter.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be but an imperfect sketch of the planter-colonist’s
social life if we did not give some account
of the great annual festive gatherings which are held
by them at the race meetings at Sonepore and other
favourite places. It will be sufficient to take Sonepore
as an example, as it is the oldest established meeting,
and also is larger and more cosmopolitan (if such a big
word is permissible) than other race meetings, and is
the trysting place where the planters of several districts
can best assemble. It is not very easy to convey
to an English reader an idea of a Sonepore meeting
except as a large picnic which lasts for about ten days.
But the picnicers do not return to their homes at the
end of each day; they live on the spot in tents which
are gathered together in separate camps, or parties, or
messes; so that independently of the general picnic
life of the whole assemblage, there are wheels within
wheels, and each separate camp or mess carries on its
own picnic on its own independent and self-supporting
arrangements. The ostensible primary object of the
Sonepore meeting is a race-meeting, but it is also
intimately connected with, and based upon, the large
Native Fair which is held simultaneously with it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>to which we shall presently recur. The race-course
runs round a flat plain rather larger perhaps than the
space enclosed by the course at Ascot or Epsom.
Almost all round the outside of the race-course there
are groves of mango trees not quite so stately as the
horse-chestnuts of Bushey Park, or the elms of the
Long Walk at Windsor, but fine old trees of considerable
height, and with a thick green foliage that affords
a grateful shade against the rays of the sun. Underneath
these groves of mango trees, stretching for nearly
a mile along the east side of the course, the several
camps are formed. Each camping-ground has its
well-defined boundaries and is rented from year to year.
One camp belongs to the young Hindoo Rajah of Durbanga,
who was lately the chief supporter of the races.
In fact he may be said to have two camps, one for his
native friends, and one for his English friends. The
Government officials of the several neighbouring districts
have their separate or combined camps. Sometimes
the Viceroy of India has had a camp, and
sometimes the Lieutenant-Governor has sent over his
tents for the meeting. The regiments from the nearest
military station have their own camps and messes, with
their bands to discourse sweet music. The planters
of the several districts have either joint or separate
camps according to their numbers and strength, and
they rival one another in hospitality. The tents of
each camp are arranged as far as possible in a square
of which one side is open and facing the road that runs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>through the grove of trees. The mess-tent of each
camp is pitched at the further side from the entrance,
and in front of it there is usually a huge awning (called
in native parlance a shamyana) which serves as an
<em>al fresco</em> drawing-room, comfortably arranged with
couches and arm-chairs, and big Persian carpets and
rugs, and other appliances. Each camp usually contains
its own Badminton courts and its lawn-tennis
court, if the trees will allow sufficient space. At the
back of the mess-tent there come the cooking-tents
and the tents for the servants, as well as for the horses
and carriages of the party. Each camp is guarded by
a party of native watchmen, who have the credit of
being hereditary thieves, but are scrupulously honest
for the occasion as regards the contents of the
camp committed to their care which they are well
paid to watch. But woe betide the self-sufficient
stranger who dispenses with the services of these
watchmen, confiding in his own prowess and the services
of his own retainers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The race-meeting at Sonepore usually takes place in
November, when the weather is beginning to be really
cool and pleasant. It is regulated by some native festival,
much as the Derby day is dependent on the date
of Easter. As the time approaches the stewards of the
meeting take measures to have the race-stand and ball-room
swept and garnished, and the camping-grounds
and race-course put in proper order. A few days before
the meet, trains of country bullock-carts may be seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>approaching the ground laden with the ponderous tents,
and beds and chairs and tables, and every kind of furniture
that is needed for civilised life. Nor is the
commissariat likely to be forgotten, whilst those who
can manage it conveniently, send over their own cows
to supply milk and butter, and the fatlings of the flock,
and huge baskets and coops full of turkeys and geese
and poultry. Ponderous deal boxes full of Fortnum and
Masonry, and cases labelled with the names of the most
promising brands of champagne and hock, and the well-known
six-dozen chests of beer, with heavy supplies of
soda and seltzer, occupy many of the carts. It is quite
a study to see how skilfully the native servants get
everything into order before their masters’ arrival; especially
the cook, who at once sets to work and extemporises
a mud kitchen, on which during the next week
he will perform culinary wonders, although it may be
well for the fastidious not to pry too narrowly into
all his proceedings, but to live in faith and satisfy
themselves with results.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the races are the ostensible object of the meeting,
all the arrangements are made with special reference to
them. There are usually four days’ races, on alternate
days, <em>i.e.</em> on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and the
ensuing Tuesday. The races take place at seven in the
morning. Thus most of the visitors arrive on Monday,
and on Monday evening the first lotteries are held for
speculation on the races which are to take place on
Tuesday morning. On Tuesday evening there is a ball;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>on Wednesday everyone is supposed to be recovering
from the effects of the combined dissipation of Tuesday’s
races and ball; until Wednesday evening provides
another lottery for speculation on the races of Thursday
morning, which are to be followed by another ball on
Thursday night; so that theoretically a day of rest
comes in between each day of pleasure, or “trouble”
as the Yankees more rightly call it.</p>

<p class='c010'>We will attempt to describe the proceedings of one
day at Sonepore. It is the first Tuesday, and we are
startled from our sleep by the bang of a big cannon,
which seems to be at the door of our tent. This is
called “gunfire,” and means that dawn is breaking. Just
as you are composing yourself to sleep again you hear
the sound of music, and there comes the band of a
native regiment playing some noisy tune as they march
along the road through the centre of all the camps, and,
having got to the end of it, back they come again
playing louder than before. Meanwhile all the servants
have been aroused, and your man comes into the tent
and tells you that it is time to get up; and, in fact,
unless you mean to cut the amusement altogether,
it is best to get up and dress. By the time you reach
your camp mess-tent you will probably find the charming
hostess who presides over your camp ready and
waiting for you with one or two of her pretty girls,
whose fresh and bright faces never look better than at
this early and trying time. Tea and coffee are ready
for you, and, as the party gradually collects in the tent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the carriages come to the entrance of the camp, and
you either drive to the race-stand, or join a walking
party with those who want the little walk to warm
them. The race-stand commands a good view of the
races; but one race is very much like another, except
that at an Indian race-course you probably know most
of the owners of the horses, or some of the gentleman-riders,
so that a stronger personal feeling exists; and
the young ladies will insist on betting for gloves and
backing the worst horse in the race, merely because it
is to be ridden by that good-looking young officer to
whom they are engaged for at least three dances at the
coming ball. The races usually last till about 10
o’clock, when we all go back to our camps and make
ready for breakfast.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the hospitable camp to which I belonged for
several years at Sonepore, the tea and coffee of breakfast
were usually followed or superseded by “just one glass
of champagne to begin with,” as our kind host would
cheerfully say, and it seemed to be generally considered
that a few glasses of good champagne were very acceptable
at breakfast after the early morning’s work. After
breakfast no one seems to think of repose. Some of
the younger people at once set to work at Badminton
and lawn-tennis; others make up parties to go to see
the horses and elephants, and other sights of the native
fair; whilst others set forth to pay visits at the other
camps, for there is a sort of unwritten law of etiquette
that all the camps should call on one another as fast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>as possible. By 2 o’clock we are summoned to lunch,
and again the champagne flows freely for those who
prefer it to beer or other liquids. After lunch the
hostess of the camp usually tries to get some of the
ladies to rest themselves in their tents, on the plea of
looking after their dresses for the ball in the evening;
but there are some perverse and indefatigable girls who
will go on with lawn-tennis, or join in a Badminton
tournament, until tea is announced. Then the carriages
and horses come to the door, and we all drive or ride
out to the course. There is probably a fierce game of
polo going on between civil and military, or the planters
of two rival districts, or the Public Schools against the
World, or any other combination of forces that can be
devised. On some days there are cricket-matches
arranged between similar parties and factions. Meanwhile
one of the military bands is playing in front of
the race-stand, and there pour forth upon the course all
the carriages and horses that can be mustered for the
occasion. There are a few ladies riding with their
attendant squires. There comes the drag of the young
Raja of Durbanga covered with his lady guests, whilst
the Raja himself handles the reins and puts his well-broken
horses into a gallop along the back of the
course. Tandems driven from high dog-carts seem to
have a special attraction for some young ladies, and
after the horses have steadied down a little to their
work, the reins are usually transferred to the hands of
the young lady until some impending danger makes it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>necessary to resume them from her. However, collisions
and accidents rarely occur; and as darkness
speedily comes on, the carriages and their occupants
soon disappear from the course and return to their
camps.</p>

<p class='c010'>About 8 o’clock the camp-gong gives the signal for
dinner, and a party of about twenty or thirty assemble
in almost every mess-tent. In a well-managed camp
the hostess generally takes care to fill up any vacancies
at her table by inviting guests from the other camps.
Any member of a camp who is going out to dinner is
expected to give early notice to his hostess, so that she
may be able to ask a friend from some other camp in
his place. By this arrangement an agreeable exchange
of hospitality is kept up, and the monotony of always
having the same set of faces avoided. Many of the ladies
appear at dinner ready dressed for the ball afterwards,
but some of the most wary ones reserve a few final
touches of dress for after dinner. It is astonishing what
a magic effect is sometimes produced by those few
final touches. It is hardly necessary to say that during
dinner much fun and merriment prevail all round the
table. However the guests may be told off and assorted
at first, it is curious to observe how, after a day or two,
certain young ladies and certain young gentlemen
always happen to sit next or near to one another at the
several meals, and take a sort of monopoly of certain
seats for themselves and their own particular acquaintances.
It not seldom happens that some unfortunate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>youth makes himself ridiculous or in some way
obnoxious to the other young people, and then they all
combine to make his life a burthen to him unless he
shows symptoms of reformation and better behaviour.
Of course, long before dinner the ball-cards of all the
best dancers are filled up, but during dinner a half
promise of one more “extra” may be secured, or some
convenient exchange of promised dances arranged to
suit the wishes of sisters or bosom friends. But we
must not linger too long over the dinner-table. The
carriages are announced to be ready, and are rapidly
filled and sent off to the ball-room, from which sometimes
they come back to be refilled by a second detachment
of the party.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ball-room at Sonepore is a well-proportioned
room which holds about two hundred people conveniently.
The music is provided by the regimental bands
in turns, and is usually very good. A long verandah
and corridor outside the ball-room, not too brilliantly
lighted up, afford a convenient retreat for those who
wish to improve the opportunities of the dance by a
little further conversation with their partner before she
returns to her chaperone, or is carried off by the man
to whom she is engaged for the next dance. If you
wander along the corridor you will come first to the
tea-room, and then to the supper-room, which will not
be opened before midnight. Dancing is usually kept up
with much spirit; and as there are always more gentlemen
than ladies, the latter seldom have to sit out a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>dance for want of a partner. But, of course, one ball
is very like another ball, and they must all come to an
end. Some prudent mammas insist on going away
before supper, others more indulgently remain throughout
the whole of the programme; but at last “God save
the Queen” admonishes even the latest lingerers that
it is time to go home. We must not follow the young
ladies to their tents; but it is very well known that
they do sit up there for a very long time, laughing and
talking over all the incidents of the ball. To the men
the hour after the ball is often one of grateful refreshment,
as we gather together in the comfortable arm-chairs
of the <em>al fresco</em> drawing-room, and sit wrapped
in our great-coats, smoking the fragrant weed, and
protecting ourselves from the cold night air with
steaming glasses of whisky-and-water, and discussing
the events of the day and the plans of the morrow, until
we retreat to our tents comforted with the knowledge
that there will be no big gun fired to wake us at daybreak,
and there will be no horrid band marching
through the camp to disturb our slumbers. And so
end the labours of a long Tuesday.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wednesday is theoretically to be a day of rest. The
camp breakfast hour is fixed at 10, but there are some
ardent spirits who know no repose, and your rest is
disturbed by the noise made in the adjacent tent by
your friends Jones and Smith, who are bent on an
expedition to shoot snipe or quail before breakfast.
Other men are getting up early to go down to the fair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>to look at the horses which are for sale; and presently
the soft voices of fair girls are heard, and you find that
two or more of them have emerged from their tents to
have just one game of lawn tennis before breakfast, by
way of practice for the impending tournament. How
delightful it must be to be young and not to know
what fatigue means! And so this theoretical day of
rest goes on. After breakfast every sort of amusement
is arranged for the day, and no one seems to
think of resting. One of the things that has to be
done at Sonepore is to go and see the native fair. It
is most convenient to go to the fair on an elephant, as
the crowds of people are so dense, and many of the
roads at the fair are too narrow, or otherwise unsuited
for carriages. So two or three elephants are brought
round, and parties made up to mount them. There is
usually room for about four persons on each elephant;
and if two young men can find themselves on an
elephant with two pretty girls, they seem to think
themselves in the seventh heaven. The movements of
an elephant are sometimes rather rough, and the fair
riders not only hold on desperately at first to the ropes,
but seldom object to be also held on by the stronger
arm of man. However, away they go, jolting and
swaying about under the trees, and trying to manage
their umbrellas or parasols so as to keep off the sun,
which still smites down fiercely with his rays. As we
arrive at the native fair, we first come upon endless
rows of horses tethered under the long ranges of trees.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>The horses are numbered by hundreds, or rather by
thousands, and come from the most distant parts of
India, and sometimes from Bokhara and Persia; some
of them look very handsome with their arched necks
and long manes. But we must not detain our fair
charges here too long. Onwards we go, a large bell
round the elephant’s neck warning the swarming
crowd to keep out of the way. The fair is laid out in
the usual Oriental style, with all the vendors of one
sort of thing collected in one place, or bazaar, as it is
called. Here is the shoe bazaar, with fifty little shops
or stalls, full of every kind of leather shoe of native
make, and the gayest slippers embroidered with gold
thread, and also a small stock of patent-leather shoes
of English make to suit the tastes of those who have
been educated to consider a patent-leather shoe as emblematic
of an acquisition of a knowledge of English.
Next we come to the cloth bazaar, where, in another
fifty shops, all the manufactures of Manchester are to
be seen, either in the original bales, or opened out and
temptingly displayed to attract customers. The next
bazaar is full of shops containing eatables, not eatables
suited to the English taste, but different sorts of rice
and grains, and confections of sugar and almonds and
cocoa-nuts and pastry, in which our native brethren
delight. At a corner where two roads cross, and the
crowd is densest, you will find an English or American
missionary mounted on a chair, and addressing the multitude
with a vehemence and earnestness which arrests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>their attention for a few moments, but, unfortunately,
seldom produces any permanent results. Presently we
come to the place where the dealers in elephants keep
these animals for sale, and we pass among these rather
dangerous monsters with some apprehension, lest a
sudden fit of jealousy or excitement should make some
irascible “Jumbo” attack our elephant. Hundreds of
elephants are standing about in groups under the trees,
whilst others are being taken down to bathe in the
neighbouring river. Onward we go, to find ourselves
amongst long strings of camels. Then we come to
the police encampment, where the native officer in
charge of the arrangements of the fair has provided a
temporary lock-up for offenders; but offences are
usually very few and trivial. Next we come to the
bazaar where the sounds of music may be heard from
morn till night, and through the long hours of
the night; whilst nautch-girls dance and sing for
the delectation of their native audience, who sit for
hours like enchanted listeners. Finally, let us visit
the bird-bazaar, where all kinds of fancy birds are
collected, parrots of all sorts in hundreds, peacocks,
quails, bulbuls, talking mynas, Java sparrows, and
hundreds of other pretty feathered creatures. At
length it is time to return to camp, and we wend our
way back under the trees, weary and dusty, and grateful
that our elephant has not walked over any of the
hundreds of thousands of our Aryan brethren amongst
whom we have been wandering. We alight from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>elephant, feeling rather happy to be released from the
back-breaking position; and, after exhibiting the wonderful
bargains and purchases which we have made,
we hasten to prepare ourselves for the pleasures of
lunch and some well-iced refreshing drink.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be tedious to go on with a repetition of
the daily laborious round of pleasure and enjoyment
which lasts for the ten days of the meeting. We have
only space to allude to one special form of pleasure,
viz. the camp-fire evenings, for which Sonepore is
particularly famous. The officers of the English regiment
usually issue an invitation for a camp-fire party
after dinner, with their band to play; or they kindly
lend their band to some other camp which may have
a larger and more convenient space for a good camp-fire.
A huge bonfire is then piled up in the centre of
the space before the camp, and when the torch is
applied it blazes up fiercely, whilst all the guests sit
round on chairs and couches and listen to the music
of the band. Sometimes a few songs and glees are
sung. It is a weird but charming scene as we look
round on all the quaint figures wrapped up in shawls
and cloaks and great-coats and extemporised head-dresses;
for it is just cold enough to make a few warm
garments acceptable, though there is no great risk of
catching cold in the calm and soft night air. There
is certainly something almost savouring of the supernatural
which comes over the mind at these camp-fire
evenings, and it is well known that many a fair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>maiden has found the time and place not unsuitable
to receive the confession of undying love and affection
which her youthful admirer had previously hesitated
to make. It may be that the bonfire was burning
low; but when it suddenly blazes out again with fresh
and bright flames, watchful eyes are not wanting to
observe how by some casual movement the unsuspecting
young pair have come into a proximity which
obviously indicates that a great and happy change has
suddenly come over their future destiny.</p>

<p class='c010'>No one who has been at a Sonepore race-meeting
can ever forget the pleasures, in so many new and
varied forms, which he there enjoyed. The life in the
open air under the shady trees, the perfect liberty of
the friendly interchange of hospitality, the cordial
greetings of old friends, the pleasant introductions to
new acquaintances, all throw a special charm over the
reminiscences of it. It is not to be wondered at that
by the planters of the adjoining districts, and also by
the Government officials, the Sonepore meeting is
looked forward to as the great event of the year. As
soon as one meeting is half over, plans and engagements
are entered into with a view to prepare for the
enjoyment of the meeting of the coming year. Let
us hope that these meetings may long continue to
flourish; and if any of my old hosts were to send a
very pressing invitation to me, I am half-inclined to
think that I would go out all the way from England
to India to take advantage of it.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='c009'>THE BENGAL CIVIL SERVICE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Lord Ellenborough, once Governor-General of India,
and formerly President of the Board of Control,
records in his political diary how the Duke of Wellington
always mentioned in high terms the gallantry
of the Indian army and the purity of the Civil
Service. We must leave it to others to write of the
Indian army. For the present we propose to devote
our attention to the Civil Service in its extensive
social relations in India. The purity of the Civil
Service may well be said to be its distinguishing
characteristic; and for this quality it was specially
held in honour by the great Duke. The pure light
of the Civil Service of India still shines like a guiding
star before the faces of the millions of our Oriental
subjects and allies.</p>

<p class='c010'>And yet there are many people in England who
have much to learn about the Indian Civil Service.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>They have heard of the Civil Service Supply Association
in London, and they know that it is managed by
the Civil Servants of the Government public offices in
London, who are fully entitled to call themselves the
Civil Servants of the Crown. In a single year about
15,000 candidates compete for the Home Civil Service,
and about 5,000 are passed. Their name is legion, and
they pervade the whole country. But the Indian
Civil Service is a much more select and exclusive
service. Only about forty new candidates are admitted
to it by competitive examination each year. These are
the recruits who are sent out annually to replenish the
Civil Service throughout the whole of India in the
three Presidencies of Bengal, Bombay, and Madras,
and their dependencies. There are less than 1,000
members of the Civil Service in the whole of India.
In the lower provinces of Bengal, to which this article
is chiefly devoted, the Civil Service consisted recently
of only 255 members. It is but a little leaven to
leaven the whole mass of the native population of
Lower Bengal, which numbers more than sixty millions
according to the last census.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is no easy task to attempt to describe the duties
of the Indian Civil Service. As to the Indian civilian
himself, the pen might almost hesitate to describe him.
It reminds us of the epitaph on a good wife—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>She was, but words are wanting to say what.</div>
      <div class='line'>Think what a wife should be, and she was that.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>It would perhaps be easier to say what an Indian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>civilian should be than what he is. He should be not
less capable and omniscient than the late Lord John
Russell, prepared to command the Channel fleet, or to
perform an operation in lithotomy. There is a story
current of a distinguished civilian in the mutinies of
1857–58 to whom Lord Clyde said, “Why, Mr. P.,
you seem to wish to command the army.” “And a
very laudable ambition too, I think, my Lord,” replied
Mr. P., unabashed. The government of a province
and its millions of inhabitants is avowedly the ultimate
aim and object of each civilian’s official life; but whilst
he is serving his apprenticeship for the higher offices
of Government, he must be prepared to adapt his
mind to the most humble and unintellectual duties.
He must learn to obey, so that he may understand how
to rule. He will have to look after the scavengers
who are occupied with the drainage and sanitation of
the town in which he lives. He will have to count
and deliver out postage-stamps with his own hands,
and woe betide him if his treasury accounts and cash
balances do not agree to the uttermost farthing. The
capacity of a civilian’s mental power should be similar
to that of the elephant’s trunk, which can pick up a
pin and pull down a mighty forest tree. There is
nothing too great, and hardly anything too small, to
which he may not in the course of his career be
expected to apply himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>The civilian is not unfrequently described in the
local newspapers as a Celestial official. There is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>linguistic basis for this epithet Celestial. Where the
Sanskrit and Bengali languages prevail, the civilian
is usually addressed by the title of Dhurmavatar, or
Incarnation of Justice. Where the Persian and Hindustani
languages are more in vogue, he is usually styled
Khudawand, which may be translated as “Lord” or
“God.” The civilian from his official cradle being thus
addressed as a superhuman personage, not unnaturally
sucks in the high-sounding titles and mentally feeds
upon them. What wonder, then, if he unconsciously
begins to think with thoughts that are not as those of
ordinary mortal men. And thus it comes to pass that
the young members of the Civil Service, nurtured on
sweet words and addressed continually by flattering
and exaggerated titles, surrounded from day to day by
suppliant and subservient attendants, and frequently
cut off from any direct communication with English
friends, do acquire a manner of thought and speech
which may strike the non-official observer as savouring
of the superhuman or Celestial type. It is unwholesome
for the human mind to live in an atmosphere of
flattery and honeyed words. We remember a native
gentleman of high rank and position who asked for an
appointment in a Government office for one of his
younger sons. “He is a good lad,” he said, “but I
want to get him placed where he will find himself
addressed by some title less than Maharajah, as he
now hears himself called by all the servants on my
establishment.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>A member of the Civil Service was formerly bound
by a covenant to serve the East India Company for
the best part of his life. He now enters into a covenant
to serve the Queen-Empress of India for a similar
term of years. There is a great gulf between the
covenanted and uncovenanted servants of the Queen,
but at present we can only treat of the covenanted
man. In “vulgar parlance” he used to be described
as an individual worth £300 a year dead or alive, and
this is still his specific social valuation. If he dies and
leaves a widow, she will receive from the Civil Fund
an annual sum of £300 a year. If whilst he lives he
falls into trouble or sickness, he is still entitled by
his covenant to a subsistence allowance of £300 a
year. He may be, and usually is, a much larger partaker
in the pecuniary advantages of his service. But
the time was when in the matrimonial market of Calcutta
the solid advantages of the covenanted young
civilian might thus be weighed against the brilliant
uniforms and ever-willing swords of his military rivals;
and if the young man owned a buggy, and a silver
teapot, and had subscribed to the Civil Fund, he was
looked on as eligible for immediate wedlock.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under the competitive system of admission to the
Civil Service, the civilian is now such a very superior
person in ability and acquirements, that we will not
attempt to describe him. But we will first refer to the
men of the old school, before the competitive system
was invented and applied to the Indian Civil Service.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>We will look back to the time when the civilian in the
earliest stage of his Indian career was a most important
factor in the fashionable world of Calcutta.
Forty or fifty years ago the young civilian, on landing
in India, was entered as a student in the College of
Fort William. He had passed through the course of
instruction and examinations of the old college at
Hertford and Haileybury. Discipline at those institutions
is said to have been sufficiently lax and irregular.
But it was required by the ruling authorities of India
that the young civilian, on arriving in India, should
again submit himself to some sort of college discipline
whilst he was studying the native languages of
India in Calcutta. A fine range of buildings called
Writers’ Buildings represented the Calcutta College.
A young civilian was in those times styled a Writer.
His appointment was called a Writership. This was
an inheritance of the mercantile nomenclature of the
East India Company. The Calcutta College owed its
constitution and existence in a great measure to the
classical theories of the great Marquis of Wellesley
when Governor-General of India. But classical
theories combined with Oriental developments are
calculated to produce a somewhat hybrid progeny.
The young civilians landed in India with a not unjustifiable
notion of their own personal and social
importance. On leaving their English college, the
Chairman of the Court of Directors had solemnly
addressed them on the dignity and responsibility of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>their position. They had been informed that they
were to be the future governors of India; they had
been told that it was their duty to demean themselves
as Christian gentlemen, to become a light to the
heathen, and the leaders of Oriental civilisation. Is it
then a matter of wonder that these young men on
arriving in Calcutta found it somewhat difficult to
submit themselves again to anything having the name
or the appearance of college or scholastic discipline?
Be it remembered that each young man on his arrival
in India was entitled to an income equivalent to nearly
four hundred pounds a year. A gentleman commoner
at an English university with £400 a year and confiding
tradesmen to give him credit, is not usually
found a good subject for discipline. What, then, could
be expected from the young men in Calcutta, with a
salary of £400 a year, and open access to the purses
of every wealthy money-lender in the country? Nor
was this all. The Government, aware of the danger
of the native money-lender’s fatal influence, endeavoured
to anticipate and avert it. Each young
civilian, whilst in college in Calcutta, was authorised
to borrow a sum of £400 from Government. The
object of this benevolence was to prevent him from
getting into the clutches of the native money-lenders.
What was the result? The taste of blood is said to
lead to the appetite for more. The young man who
had found a loan of £400 almost forced on him by a
paternal Government, experienced no difficulty in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>borrowing several thousand pounds from the native
money-lender, who, it may be said, felt confident that
the Government would eventually see that he was
repaid. The wildest extravagance naturally resulted
from this system. The nabob who in the plenitude of
his acquired wealth ordered “more curricles,” was
practically outdone by the young civilian who, with a
nominal income of £400 a year, maintained an
establishment in Calcutta in which he would not allow
the Arab horses in his stable to be counted. He
seldom had less than forty horses, but he considered it
unlucky to count them. This officer rose subsequently
to the highest eminence in the service, and not only
paid all his debts, but acquired a respectable competency.
A cousin of this gentleman, who also
achieved the highest official honours, had a similar
love for horses. He had a stud of English race-horses
and an English jockey in charge of them. It would be
easy but tedious to enumerate other splendid examples
of youthful extravagance. It was the fashion to get in
debt to the amount of a lakh of rupees, or £10,000,
before leaving college. The cautious and canny young
man who did not condescend to borrow the £400
proffered to him by Government, was looked upon with
very little feeling of respect by anyone, except perhaps
his mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>The time came in due course when the college of
Fort William was reformed. Writers’ Buildings were
closed as a residential college. The young writers on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>arriving in India were ordered to remain in Calcutta to
obtain a certain qualification in the native languages,
but they were expected to live with friends who would
keep them under greater social restraint; or to find
their own habitations, where it is needless to say
that there was no social restraint. The result was
that three or four young men who had been friends
at the college of Haileybury, in England, joined one
another in setting up a house or mess in Calcutta.
The Government no longer offered its loan of £400 to
each young man. The chief evidence of college discipline
(the name of the college being still maintained)
consisted in the daily appearance of a venerable native
gentleman called a Moonshee or a Pundit; and in a
monthly examination in the College Hall, before the
Principal and two paid examiners. The venerable
native gentlemen who came as instructors in the
languages were usually ignorant of English, and were
therefore unacceptable to their pupils. They had no
personal interest in their pupils, as they drew their
Government salary without reference to the progress
of their pupils. They attended solemnly from day to
day, and were as solemnly requested to come again
to-morrow. When a young writer really wished to
learn the languages, he invoked the help of one of the
two private teachers, Raj Chunder and Harry Mohun
who were good English scholars, and so made the path
of learning a little more pleasant. Each young writer
was required to qualify in the languages in either one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>or two years after his arrival in India, and so the time
came at last when he was obliged to call in the private
tutors. Somehow or other these private tutors had a
great prophetic power of anticipating the particular
passages in the text-books, and the particular papers
for translation which would be used at any coming
examination. Or if it turned out that they had been
mistaken when the day of examination came, they
were usually in attendance within reach of the examination
hall, and mysteriously entered into some electro-biological
or theosophical communication with their
pupils, if any of these were nervous or doubtful of
their own powers. We would beg, however, emphatically
to record that most of the men passed their
examinations by their own knowledge and ability.
There were always a certain number of men who
attained honours and pecuniary rewards and medals
for their superior proficiency in the languages; but
there were sometimes a few whose idleness and negligence
compelled them at the last moment to have
recourse to electro-biological assistance.</p>

<p class='c010'>But whilst the studious existence of the College was
thus carried on, its social existence was much more
pleasant and influential. Three or four young men
living together kept up an establishment which seldom
cost any one of them less than £100 per month, his
pay from Government being £35. Almost every young
civilian used to keep at least three horses and a
buggy. The number of their native servants was so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>large that we hesitate to write it. The use of the
hookah was fashionable, and almost every young man
kept a man and a boy to look after this elaborate
smoking apparatus. Each student had two or three
table servants, arrayed in gay liveries with silver
crests. Every student belonged to the Bengal Club,
to the Racket Club, to the Cricket Club, to the Swimming
Club, to the Turf Club, and a few really good
riders were admitted to the Tent Club. Proficiency
at billiards was a common accomplishment. Play
rather than proficiency at whist was the rule, and the
stakes were not less than four sovereigns on each
rubber, whilst a little quiet betting easily doubled and
quadrupled these petty stakes. But there were many
other pleasant and necessary expenses. Private parties
to ladies, theatricals, and public balls were to be got
up at the expense of the young civilians in college,
of course in return for the pleasant and ample hospitality
extended to them by the residents of Calcutta.
Even the expense of dress was not inconsiderable.
The usual number of young civilians belonging to
the college was about thirty, and at least twenty of
this number would appear on the Course, or Rotten
Row of Calcutta, every evening, dressed in the highest
light of fashion, as an example to the rest of the
fashionable world who had been longer exiled from
England. But in addition to the ordinary civil society
of Calcutta, the young civilian had to keep himself on
good terms with the messes of the regiments in Fort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>William and at Barrackpore, and at the famous old
Artillery mess at Dumdum which was then in its palmy
days. It was nothing unusual for a young civilian to
entertain a large party of his young friends at the
Bengal Club, when champagne flowed like water; sometimes,
perhaps, it flowed too freely. There is an old
but true story of a young civilian who had been entertaining
his friends at the Bengal Club. After dinner,
and, we may add, after midnight, he was driving home
to his house with his new buggy and his best horse
and harness, all purchased within the last week, when
at an awkward turn of the road he pulled the wrong
rein, and his spirited horse plunged headlong into a
deep tank or reservoir of water. How the master and
his groom saved their lives is hardly known. The
unfortunate horse was drowned, and the buggy
was fished out next day looking anything but gay.
The young man wrote home to his father, asking
for funds to buy a new horse and buggy, but
he received a stern reply:—“I cannot understand,
my dear son, how a young man in your position can
require to keep three horses, three grooms, and a
cabriolet.” But the good old man sent the money
asked for.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the present day the college of Fort William no
longer exists as a college for young civilians. They
are so fully crammed and instructed and examined
under the competition system that they are supposed to
arrive in India fully acquainted with the native languages.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>They are, therefore, at once sent off to join
their official appointments as subordinates in various
districts. They have thus no longer any opportunity of
exercising or learning to exercise in the capital that
social influence which their predecessors enjoyed. Perhaps
it is fortunate for society that it is not subjected to
the combined and overwhelming galaxy of talent that
would be found in a band of twenty or thirty young
men radiant with all the honour and glory of successful
competition in England, and having as yet had
little or no opportunity of finding their proper level
with the rest of the working world. We have heard
of a story of a young competitive civilian who was
asked to dine at the Bengal Club, an institution of
which the members are chiefly barristers, merchants,
and bankers, with a sprinkling of civilians and
military men, who all fancy that they live rather well
and generously. “I think,” said the young man to
his host of the evening, “I could venture to point
out to you several solecisms in your club dinner; for
instance, the servants actually handed me two kinds of
fish at the same time.” The host kindly explained
that the servants had <em>shown</em> the two dishes to the
young stranger because he could not understand what
they tried to say to him in the native language.
Presently, on adjourning to the billiard-room, this
young stranger observed an indifferent player pocket
his adversary’s ball. “Ah,” he said, “do you allow
that play here? The club to which I belonged in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>London considered it ungentlemanly.” But, fortunately,
competitive civilians of this highly aristocratic
breed and exquisite sweetness and light are rather
uncommon, and many of them are as fine specimens
of manly and well-educated Englishmen as it could
be possible to find in any part of the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>When a young civilian enters upon the active
duties of his profession he is first styled an assistant.
Under this description he is the assistant to the magistrate
and collector of a particular district. He is
vested with certain limited judicial and fiscal authority.
He can inflict a small amount of imprisonment,
and impose moderate fines in the criminal cases which
he tries as assistant magistrate. He may be put
in charge of the treasury, and have to deal with sundry
matters connected with the land revenue in his capacity
of assistant collector. The making or marring of
a young assistant sometimes depends not a little on the
character of the magistrate-collector under whom he
is appointed to serve. The assistant may know a great
many things, but when he comes face to face with his
actual work in office he finds that he has still very
much to learn. He is probably stuffed full of English,
Mahomedan, and Hindoo law; he has doubtless
passed his examinations in the Oriental languages;
but when he takes his seat in court he promptly finds
that there is something very wrong. The natives by
whom he is surrounded apparently do not understand
their own language; they pronounce it so strangely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>that what they say is not intelligible to him. They
certainly fail to understand what he says to them;
and as to the legal knowledge with which he expected
to astonish them, he finds no opportunity for displaying
it. He hears something about an Act—and about
duffers—and he suspects that he is being rudely chaffed
as a duffer. Now-a-days, relief comes to him usually
from one of the native officials in attendance on him,
who can speak English, and insinuatingly becomes his
interpreter—in fact, his guide, philosopher, and friend.
But an assistant is often and ought always to be saved
from this abrupt and false position, in entering on his
duties, if he will take a little quiet instruction from the
magistrate and collector under whom he is to serve.
When he joins his district he should first practise
anatomy on a few defunct bodies, instead of beginning
with vivisection on an actual case. If he will read
through the records of a few old decided cases, under the
friendly guidance of his magistrate, and in the privacy
of his own room, he will soon become master of all the
leading technicalities and phraseology of the cases,
which he will ordinarily have to decide. He will soon
become used to the language of the native officers
appointed to attend on him, and will learn to practise
his own tongue to the colloquial abbreviations and
expressions which differ so widely from the language of
the vernacular text-books. Above all things, let him
not fear to ask for an explanation of whatever he does
not understand, and let him take a note of the explanation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>given. In after days he will look back at his
notes with much satisfaction and amusement at his
own quondam ignorance, and he will be the more ready
to give help and instruction to the young men who
come after him.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the assistant will open his eyes and look round him
thoughtfully, he will soon come to observe the gravity
and importance of the official position which he now
holds. The district contains more than a million inhabitants.
The assistant will be surprised to find that
he holds the fourth place in the official hierarchy of
the district. There are the judge, the collector-magistrate,
and the joint-magistrate ranking above him, but
his official place is fourth on the list. What a difference
this is from his position in his native land, where
he was probably next to nobody, and certainly exercised
no sort of authority. Now he has become the
fourth in rank amongst a million of people. Many
young men are rather slow to perceive this. Very
probably a becoming sense of modesty restrains them
from attempting to assert the position. But the fact
remains, and the official responsibility positively exists.
Many an assistant, owing to the casual illness or temporary
absence of his official superiors, has suddenly
found himself actually the first official among a million
of people. In no other part of the world, in no other
condition of society, does official responsibility so suddenly
thrust itself on a young man about twenty years
of age.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>In the ordinary routine of social life at a small civil
station, the assistant at first holds a comparatively
humble position. A civil station is the capital of a
district. The society consists principally of members
of the Civil Service; there is the judge, who is usually
between thirty and forty years of age; the collector-magistrate
is now sometimes senior, sometimes junior,
to the judge; next comes the joint-magistrate and
deputy-collector, a sort of second in command to the
collector-magistrate; and next comes the assistant.
Outside this nucleus of the Civil Service there come
the police officers, the doctor, the clergyman, and one
or two other minor English officials, and perhaps a few
independent men employed in mercantile business or
owning landed estates. If there is a railway running
through the district, it may contribute an engineer to
the little society, or there may be an officer of the
Public Works Department located there. In Bengal,
military detachments very seldom help to swell the
numbers of a civil station. In fact, with the ladies
of the several families, a party of twenty can seldom
be assembled, except on the most important festive
occasions.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a very small world such as this, it is not surprising
that the assistant, to some extent, acquiesces in
his native designation as the “chota saheb,” or little
saheb, of the community. He is treated as a newcomer,
willing to learn and to be pleased at acquiring
experience from the older folks around him. If he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>a sensible man, he really feels how very much of practical
life he has yet to learn.</p>

<p class='c010'>After an assistant has been about a year at a district
station, and when he has passed certain examinations
with which the Government still persists in unnecessarily
tormenting its junior servants, he is usually sent
to what is called a sub-division of the district. The
inventor of sub-divisions was undoubtedly an enemy to
his brethren. To be in charge of a sub-division means,
in most cases, that the assistant is cut off from all
communication with his fellow-Englishmen. He is
undoubtedly monarch of all he surveys, but his realms
are rather pitiful. He has an official dwelling, usually
much out of repair; sometimes it is only a mat and
thatched building, but too frequently one part of the
building serves as a dwelling-house, and the other
part serves as the public office, so that privacy or quiet
is almost unattainable. Within a few yards of the
dwelling-house the lock-up of the prisoners under trial
or under sentence presents itself, with a guard-house
for the police detachment. A small tank or pond, in
which the prisoners and their guard bathe, also serves
to supply the assistant and his domestics with water.
There may be some half-cultivated scrap of garden,
and sometimes there is actually a bit of road along
which a wheeled vehicle can be driven, at least as far
as the broken bridge, for the repair of which the estimates
have been several months under consideration
before some superior officer. The reader may imagine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the feelings of the young official on finding himself in
charge of such a kingdom as this. There is not
another white face to be seen. If he falls ill, there is a
half-trained native doctor to attend to him. His nearest
white neighbour is probably an indigo-planter, with
whom he may not be on good terms, as he may have
decided cases adversely to the planter’s interests.
Meanwhile his official duties are not only onerous but
irksome. He is expected to be a jack-of-all-trades. He
has complicated criminal cases before him in his magisterial
capacity. The native lawyers who practise in his
court are usually men of inferior quality, who have
not succeeded in their business at the chief station
of the district. The native officers who belong to
his court are ill-paid, and too often inefficient. They
have at the best a very limited experience, and
are not qualified to supply the assistant’s own want of
experience. He has to look after his treasury, and to
send in all sorts of accounts to the head-quarters of
the district. There is hardly a sub-division in which
the accounts are kept correctly. In too many there
are embezzlements or some fraudulent practices which
the assistant fails to detect until he has become in a
measure responsible for them, so that when he discovers
them he has practically to report evil of himself.
His work is carried on for many hours in a
crowded room, in a hot and reeking atmosphere. Just
as he hopes that his daily labours are coming to an
end, there arrives from a remote police-station a corpse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and a confessing murderer. The corpse has to be sent
to the native doctor for a post-mortem examination,
with such information as the assistant can obtain from
the police reports as to the nature of the injuries which
caused death. This must be done promptly—for
corpses will not keep, in fact, they are often very unpleasant
when they reach the assistant’s office. Nor
will the murderer’s confession keep; it must be taken
down at once, while the criminal is still in a state of
awe and repentance, and faint with hunger. The police
are careful not to let a confessing criminal have too
much to eat until he has repeated his confession
voluntarily and entirely of his own free will, before the
assistant. So, however weary the assistant may be, he
must solemnly admonish the prisoner not to confess
unless he likes to do so, and then record what the unfortunate
creature has to state. When this is over,
he hopes to get away, but there is an emergent application
for postage-stamps which he does not dare
postpone, and he has to count them out from the chest
in his little murky den of a treasury, and check all the
entries in the account-books before he can close them
with a correct balance of the stamps still in store. At
last he may gain the privacy of his own rooms, and
the company of his sole and faithful companion, his
dog. But even then his troubles are not always at an
end. Perhaps an alarm of fire is given from the neighbouring
village. The sky is red with flames, and dense
clouds of smoke fill the air. The assistant quickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>mounts his horse, and dashes off to the scene, to try
and control the crowd, and to direct the efforts of
those few who seem to have their senses left, in
attempting to extinguish the flames, or prevent the
conflagration from spreading. He will be lucky if he
succeeds in doing any good. He will be very lucky if
he escapes without some personal injury, and he will
probably meet with execrations instead of thanks from
those people whose huts have had to be pulled down in
order to prevent the fire from spreading.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is sometimes at a sub-division a great opportunity
for getting good sport if the assistant is fond
of hunting or shooting. Near the principal station of
many districts the game is becoming exhausted; but
in a remote sub-division there are usually some natural
game-preserves which have not been so often invaded
by the adventurous English sportsman. As to snipe,
he will probably find them in his own garden any
time between September and March; and the rice-swamps
which come up to the edge of his garden are
sure to be full of snipe in different places as the waters
of the annual inundation begin to subside. Wild
ducks of infinite variety and in numbers innumerable
are to be found in some of the quiet inland backwaters
branching from the nearest great river. The wild hogs
are seldom wanting. The villagers will gladly point
out these dangerous enemies to their crops; and if the
ground is rideable, some friends with their horses and
spears may occasionally be brought together for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>good day’s sport. Leopards are to be heard of in
many villages, and when a particular leopard makes
itself troublesome by killing the goats of the villagers
or perhaps scratching and wounding some old woman,
the assistant will be asked to go and shoot it. Tigers
are scarce animals now; but they roam over large
distances, and a tiger sometimes makes its appearance
and establishes itself in a village, to the utter dismay
of the inhabitants, who see their cattle killed daily,
and live in constant apprehension for their own safety.
But when a tiger is thus heard of, let the assistant
not trust too much to his own prowess, or to the aid
of any native companions who are willing to accompany
him to kill the tiger. Let him remember the
fate of poor Langdon, who went out a few years ago
with a single-barrelled gun in his hand and a revolver
in his belt to slay a tiger that had taken up its abode
in a neighbouring village. He was attended by a
crowd of natives armed with matchlocks, swords, and
clubs. They formed a sort of line and advanced upon
the tiger, who was sitting on his haunches in an open
rice-field, looking at them. Poor Langdon fired his
single barrel when he was about twenty yards from
the tiger. He probably missed the beast, who came
down with a bound and seized him by the neck and
killed him like a terrier kills a rat. His native companions
very naturally took to their heels. They are
hardly to be blamed. They had little chance of killing
the tiger, and their only safety was in flight. Not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>long previous to poor Langdon’s death a stray tiger
similarly visited another district, and two or three of
the young civilians, with a police officer who had shot
many tigers, made an expedition to slay it. They
found the tiger lying by a little hut in an open field.
They approached cautiously, and made certain of their
prey. A crowd of gaping villagers watched them
from a high bank of earth, which seemed a safe place
of refuge. At a given signal the experienced police-officer
fired the first shot, and his companions each
fired off both barrels. The tiger rose unharmed and
looked at them; but fortunately his wrath was
directed to the noisy native villagers on the high
bank and he rushed off towards them, scattering them
like a flock of sheep. The young officials and their
police-mentor returned to their homes sadder and
wiser men, not likely to go out again on foot in quest
of a tiger.</p>

<p class='c010'>The life of an assistant civilian at a sub-division is
a life of toil and drudgery. But relief may come
unexpectedly. One gloomy day, when his misfortunes
seem at their worst, he finds a letter informing him
that he has been appointed to act as under-secretary
to the Government of the province. He can hardly
understand or believe, at first, the good fortune that
has come to him. He had begun to fancy that he was
forgotten by all the world and by his friends. But
when he tells the news to his native officials they are
not slow to congratulate him. They tell him how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>under-secretaries are the men who eventually become
lieutenant-governors. They almost worship him,
and pray that their humble services may not be forgotten
when he comes into his kingdom. But he must
wait anxiously for a few days until his successor comes
to relieve him, and then he rushes off eagerly to the
capital, with hardly less change in his position and
prospects than that of the butterfly who has emerged
from his previous humble form.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the ordinary routine of the career of an Indian
civilian in Bengal, he rises from an assistant to be
a joint-magistrate, and he then becomes either a
collector-magistrate or a judge of a district—and he
never emerges from this quiet and hard-working
career. If he is a judge he may, after twenty years
or more, hope to obtain a seat in the High Court. If
he is a collector-magistrate he may similarly hope to
become a commissioner, and eventually to rise to be
a member of the Board of Revenue. But outside the
ordinary routine of appointments there are a certain
number of offices which may be considered to be the
special prizes of the service. To get into the secretariat
is the very laudable desire of almost every young
civilian. In the first place the pay of the under-secretary
is very much larger than that of most of his
contemporaries. But the pay is mere dross in comparison
with the power and change of position which
a secretariat appointment confers. His other brethren
are the ordinary rank and file—but he has become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>an officer in command, and he issues his orders
accordingly. It is much more pleasant to command
than to obey, especially to those who have themselves
been disciplined in the school of obedience. It is true
that the under-secretary, in writing an official letter,
informs his correspondent that he is directed by his
honour the lieutenant-governor of the province to
bid him do this or abstain from doing that; but the
personality of the under-secretary is not always concealed,
or rather it derives part of its glory and
brilliancy from the association of his name with that
of the lieutenant-governor. But it is not merely to
his own friends and contemporaries that the young
under-secretary stands forth as the representative of
the highest authority. When he was an assistant
he may have demeaned himself humbly before the
collector-magistrate who was his immediate master.
He probably felt a sort of mysterious awe as regards
the officer styled a commissioner of division, who is
the superior master of several collector-magistrates
and their assistants. But as an under-secretary he
finds himself issuing orders to these commissioners,
with instructions to them to communicate his orders
to the collector-magistrates. In fact, official etiquette
in the secretariat almost precludes him from direct
communication with his former superior, the collector-magistrate.
There is yet another strong point of
contrast between the position of the under-secretary
and that of his unpromoted brethren, the sub-divisional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>officers whom we have tried to describe. The latter
have hardly anyone to help them in their offices.
Their work is usually carried on in a noisy, crowded
room, with many interruptions. They have to draft
their own letters, and will do wisely even to examine
the despatch copies made by their clerks. But in the
secretariat everything is very different. The under-secretary
has his comfortable and quiet room, to which
no one has access except on business, and with his
permission. His work is all neatly prepared for him.
The red-taped bundles are sorted in their proper boxes.
Office-notes are put up explaining the subject, or
giving a convenient clue to important papers. If
anything appears obscure the under-secretary touches
his bell and summons an experienced office-clerk to
his aid. He can order further information to be
supplied from the office. But, above all, he finds a
draft, put up from the office, of almost every letter that
is to issue. It is much less laborious work to sign a
well-prepared draft, or even to correct an ill-composed
draft, than to have to write each letter with his own
hand. When the despatch copies of the letters are
brought for his signature he signs them by the dozen
bravely, and trusts to the office “examiner” for their
correctness. There are, of course, many important
cases where the under-secretary must compile notes,
and prepare the papers for submission to his superior,
the secretary, and he must expect sometimes to have
them sent back to him from the secretary for further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>elucidation. Sometimes the secretary or the lieutenant-governor
himself wants some orders issued
very urgently, and the under-secretary may have a
few hours of hard work, or slavery, if he likes to call
it so. But, as a rule, he has a very pleasant time of
it in his office; and if he keeps his work well in hand,
and does not allow any arrears of bundles to accumulate
against him, he will discover the value of the
motto “<i><span lang="la">Mihi res non me rebus</span></i>,” and will find little
to interfere with his enjoyment of the social pleasures
of the capital. He may even find time for hunting
and shooting, if such are his tastes. He can ride and
play polo, or he can make his choice between rackets
and lawn-tennis, or cricket when cricket is in season.
The doors of every fashionable house are open to him
if he chooses to leave his card. If he is a good
musician he will be all the more welcome. If he can
dance well he will have no difficulty in finding partners.
At his club he becomes a sort of authority, and has
to practice the affectation of being mysterious about
trifles, so as to keep himself in training to baffle inconvenient
questions on official matters of importance.
Whatever social pleasures and amenities life in the
capital of Bengal affords, these are all at the disposal
of the fortunate civilian under-secretary.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have hitherto written of the junior officers in the
Civil Service. Promotion in the ordinary course is
regulated principally by seniority. The whole scheme
of the Civil Service in Bengal and in the other provinces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>of India is like the iron framework of a
machine, in which all the principal parts consist of
members of the Civil Service. As the older members
are used up and worn out, the younger members are
fitted into their places. The Government sometimes
removes a man who does not seem strong enough for
his share in the work, and transfers him to a position
where the strain on his power is less, and replaces him
by a stronger man. To most men the first direct
object of their ambition is to obtain charge of a district.
After about ten years of subordinate service, the
civilian finds himself appointed as collector and magistrate
to the charge of a district, and he thus becomes
the direct representative of the executive government
of the country. The title “collector-magistrate” is
somewhat vague and misleading, especially to English
readers unacquainted with India. The word “collector”
has no special dignity or authority about it.
Our own juvenile reminiscence of a collector in England
was of the local collector of taxes, a man with a
white apron and a pen behind his ear, and a portable
ink-bottle at his waist. An Indian collector, at least
in Bengal, is a collector almost only in name. The
revenues of the district are doubtless collected under
his superintendence, but he has almost as little connection
personally with the actual collection as the
Governor of the Bank of England has with the sovereigns
and bank-notes which pass through his bank.
The title of “magistrate” is scarcely less misleading.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>It is true that he is the chief magistrate of the district,
but he has very little direct concern with the actual
trial of the criminal cases in his district. But the
title of “collector-magistrate” exists in Bengal, and
therefore we must deal with it. In reality he is the
administrator of a small province which contains a
population from one to two million inhabitants. For
the details of his administration he has civilian and
non-civilian subordinates, each of whom is invested
with certain fiscal or magisterial powers. He distributes
the work of the district amongst these officers.
To one he assigns the care of his treasury and
accounts; to another he delegates the management of
the excise; to a third he makes over the duty of
measuring and assessing landed estates which require
a readjustment of the burden of their land revenue;
to a fourth he entrusts the special care of those
properties belonging to minors and others which come
under him as the representative of the Court of
Wards. In his magisterial capacity he makes over
certain classes of criminal cases to certain subordinates,
or assigns to them a limited local jurisdiction for the
criminal cases that may occur in it. He is the head
of the police of the district, although he has a special
officer styled the district superintendent of police by
whom all the details of police work are carried on.
He is usually the chairman of municipal committees,
and of any local body of management connected with
education, hospitals, or charitable dispensaries. All
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>schools, especially vernacular schools, are supposed to
be his peculiar care. The local jail and its prisoners
are under his control, though the doctor or some
special officer is in immediate charge of the jail. He
is expected to keep himself well-informed as to the
trading and commercial interests of the district, and
is responsible for the care of the roads and bridges
throughout the country. He is expected to keep himself
well-informed of all that is going on in the sub-divisions
of his district which are in the immediate
charge of the sub-divisional officers whom we have
already described. If cattle-disease breaks out in the
interior, he is expected to report on it and take measures
to put an end to it. If fever or cholera begin
to devastate any part of his dominion, he must at
once take action to contend with the enemy. If troops
are marching through the district, he must see to the
clearance of the encampment grounds, and to the
provision of rations for the soldiers and their camp-followers.
If there is no clergyman at the station, he
may be called on to baptise infant children, and much
more certainly to bury anyone who dies. He will
have also to provide for the conduct of the weekly
church service. We have by no means exhausted the
list of his duties; but finally, if a prisoner in his
jurisdiction is sentenced to be hung, it will be his duty
to superintend the execution. He is held personally
responsible by the Government that everything goes
right in the district. He has many hands to help him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>in the details of his numerous duties, but still he is
expected to put his own finger occasionally into every
man’s pie; and if he abstains as much as possible
from exercising any primary authority, there is hardly
a matter in which he is not referred to as the appellate
authority by those who are dissatisfied with the orders
of his subordinates. To carry out all his functions he
should be an Argus and a Briareus. He is often a
little sickly-looking man in spectacles.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Those who have seen Tom Taylor’s play, “The Overland
Route” at the Haymarket Theatre, have probably
been amused at the representation of the old civilians
Sir Solomon Fraser, K.C.B., and Mr. Colepepper, who
are two of the principal characters of the piece. It
may also be said to afford a favourable opportunity
for old Indians of seeing themselves as others see
them. Sir Solomon is the representative of the old
school of political officers, who passed the chief part
of their life as residents in native independent
states. Mr. Colepepper is the hard-working old man
who finished his career in the service as a commissioner,
without any special rewards or titles, and
under some mysterious liability to Government for
many thousands of pounds, certain vouchers having
been lost in the mutinies. With reference to these
imaginary individuals we will give a brief sketch of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>a few more of the many branches into which the
career of an Indian civilian may develop itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Political Department, as it was called, in India,
was for a long time considered the most eligible
and enviable line in which a young civil officer could
shape his career. There was a time when the most promising
young men were specially selected by Government,
and sent off to the famous capital at Hyderabad
to graduate under the guidance of the eminent chief
Charles Metcalfe, then resident at that native court.
Residents and Governor-General’s agents were formerly
to be found in many parts of India. The
resident was the officer who was supposed to advise,
or, we ought to say, imperceptibly to influence, the
independent native prince or princess to whose
court he was accredited. The Governor-General’s
agent was the representative of British authority,
or, to put it more plainly, the instructor or bear-leader
of those native princes whose authority was
not independent, but who needed to be instructed
or to be led according to their own individual
capacity or incapacity in exercising their own limited
power and jurisdiction. The officer employed in
either position was supposed to be well-versed in all
matters connected with the etiquette and ceremonial
of native courts, and it was essential that he himself
should be distinguished for his grave and imperturbable
courtesy of demeanour and speech. He
was expected to be a master of all the arts of intrigue,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>not so much for the purpose of carrying on any active
intrigue, but rather for the sake of baffling those
intrigues which are the life and breath of a native
court, where mine must occasionally be met by
counter-mine. For the word intrigue includes, and
indeed usually consists of, the very smallest matters,
in dealing with which the political officer only keeps
his weapons sharpened in readiness to deal with any
matter of real gravity and importance. A resident
formerly was almost isolated from the fellowship of
his own countrymen, save of those who constituted
his own staff or assistants. But this form of society
is always mentally unwholesome, as the chief finds
no one who is prepared openly to differ from his
opinions, or to maintain any serious argument against
him. Hence the resident of the pre-mutiny period
sometimes became a rather pompous self-opiniated
punctilious and artificial sort of person, who is exemplified
in Sir Solomon Fraser, K.C.B. The race of
political officers is now comparatively extinct, and the
circumstances under which they exist have been so
materially altered by the introduction of railways
and the general improvement in the means of interchanging
ideas with their fellow-men, that any man
who allowed himself to acquire the ways and habits,
of his fossil predecessors would probably be deemed
unfit for his post, although he will still be careful to
observe the professional courtesy and demeanour for
which we ought not to fail to give due credit to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>members of the old school of politicals. Writing as
we are with reference to the province of Bengal, it may
be said that political residents are non-existent, and
the few Governor-General’s agents, who are still employed
at the Court of the Nawab of Morshedabad
and on some of the frontier divisions, have been much
shorn of their honours and emoluments.</p>

<p class='c010'>With regard to Mr. Colepepper, who has been presented
in the play as the type of the commissioner,
we do not mean to say that the portrait will be actually
recognised, as there are few now left who are able to
identify the men who served their country so well
and so patiently both before and during the mutinies;
but we are inclined to think that someone has unconsciously
sat for his portrait on this occasion, and we
do not feel that he has anything to be ashamed of in
it. A man who has spent his life under an Eastern
sun, surrounded by Oriental influences, must not
suppose that he is like his contemporaries who have
never left the shores of England. His curious garb,
his white sun-hat, his thin white coat and trousers,
present as great a contrast to the broad-cloth garments
and regulation hat of his English compeer as may
be found in their respective thoughts and feelings.
And we are not at all prepared to admit that all
the mental advantage or even the physical superiority
is on the side of the stay-at-home Englishman. It
may be that the man who has served in India has
attained all his Oriental learning and practical administrative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>experience in addition to his natural privileges
and mental acquirements as an Englishman. He
has, perhaps, seen some things from the wrong end
of the telescope; but have his brethren in England
always taken a more correct view of Indian objects?
The heart and mind of the one have probably been
enlarged by an enlightened sympathy for millions of
new and strange people, whilst the other has passed
his life in the narrow prejudices of his own profession
or business, and in the surroundings of his own
country parish. The one may have endured the
burden and heat of the sun, which has blanched the
colour from his cheeks, and left him a lean and
yellow visage and disorganised liver. But is the
other very much better off who has grown corpulent
and unwieldy with too much good-living and too
much old port wine, whilst his limbs are often racked
by rheumatism, if he has not become a victim to gout
and dyspepsia?</p>

<p class='c010'>However, though there may be individual exceptions
to every rule, the mind of the British public is tolerably
well made up that Mr. Colepepper is a genuine specimen
commissioner of the Indian Civil Service, and we are
content to leave them in that belief. But the title of
commissioner conveys no sort of distinct idea to the
English mind. It is curious how wanting many Indian
titles are in precision, or even in affording any suggestion
of their meaning. We remember a story where a
good-natured old commissioner was sitting at dinner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>next the colonel of a regiment which had just come to
Calcutta from the North-West Provinces. The commissioner
casually said to the colonel, “I am the animal
which is called a commissioner in this part of the
world.” The colonel was immensely delighted. He
had been accustomed to their high mightinesses the
commissioners of the North-West Provinces; and it
was a strange thing to him to find a commissioner
speaking almost disrespectfully of his own title. But
there are commissioners and commissioners. The commissioner
in Bengal is the officer in chief executive
charge of a territorial division, each division containing
six or seven separate districts, with a total population
of about eight or ten millions inhabitants. There are
some divisions in which for geographical reasons the
area is smaller, and the population of the division less
numerous. The commissioner is usually an officer in
what may be called the prime of Indian official life,
about forty years of age, and of about twenty years’
standing in his service. He is usually selected by
Government from the executive officers known as
collector-magistrates of districts, and the selection not
unfrequently causes considerable jealousy and dissatisfaction,
especially if the selected commissioner
happens to be junior to any of the collector-magistrates
in the division to which he is appointed. The commissioner
is the local representative of Government in his
own division. The Government sends its orders to
him, and he passes them on to the collector-magistrates.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>On the same principle the collector-magistrates submit
their reports to Government through the commissioner.
He is the chief local authority, save that the district
judges are entirely independent of him; and the judicial
independent authority thus established is the recognised
constitutional safety-valve, which is intended to provide
against any injudicious or casual stretch of authority
on the part of the executive. The commissioner is the
head of the police throughout his division; but here
again there are some subtle niceties of discipline and
practice. The commissioner receives written reports
from the police, through the district-magistrate, of the
progress of their investigations in all heinous and
important cases. But his power is limited. He cannot
issue direct orders to the actual police officers investigating
a case, so as to bid them arrest one suspected
person or release another. He may offer friendly advice
and suggestions to the magistrate with regard to the
action of the police; and he may also, if dissatisfied
with their proceedings, make unpleasant remarks and
comments. But the discipline of the police force is
regulated by a hierarchy of its own, consisting of
district-superintendents and deputy inspectors-general,
and an inspector general, who is equal in official rank
to the commissioner, and in direct communication with
Government. And as the commissioner may interfere
with the police only under certain limitations, so, on the
other hand, he must be very cautious to abstain from
interference with any case the moment that it has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>sent up by the police for trial before any magisterial or
judicial officer. Any interference by the executive in
the judicial trial of a case is strongly resented; but it
is open to a commissioner to set the public prosecutor
in motion, or to employ special counsel to look after the
effective prosecution of a difficult and important case.
Eventually, if a particular case, or any class of cases,
becomes of such deep interest as to require the attention
of Government—or if the Government has called
for a report—it is the commissioner who has to represent
the whole of the facts to Government, and it is then
open to him to express his opinion unreservedly on the
good or bad conduct of the police, and this is also his
opportunity for pointing out to Government any defects
that may have occurred in the judicial proceedings.
But in this part of the business he will do well to
temper his words with discretion. If the commissioner
expresses an opinion, in his report to Government, that
the magistrate or judge who tried the case has made
any serious mistake as to his facts or to his law, this
practically amounts to a proclamation of war. The
Government on receiving the commissioner’s report to
this effect will not be in a hurry to pronounce an
opinion. It will probably send the report of the commissioner
to the judges of the High Court, and will
request them to inquire and report what the magistrate
or judge has to say on his own behalf. Of course the
magistrate or judge in most instances stoutly maintains
that he was right, and it may be that the judges of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>High Court also take the part of the judge or magistrate,
or at all events extenuate his errors. Then the Government
may either give the commissioner an opportunity
for a rejoinder, or it may proceed to put an end to the
case by passing a decision on it. The approved Government
secretariat style of decision is to find a little
fault with everybody; and the principle of decisions of
this kind is simple and obvious, because it discourages
all the officers concerned from desiring again to bring
their quarrels or differences into prominence, so that
they will not come up bothering the Government again
for a long time to come. It may be observed that the
Government is usually very careful to agree as far as
possible with the judges of the High Court, and to throw
over the complainant commissioner. So the commissioner
probably finds, to his annoyance, that he has
taken a great deal of trouble to do his duty, with the
highly satisfactory result that he is told, like a naughty
boy, not to do it again.</p>

<p class='c010'>The commissioner is also the chief revenue authority
throughout his division, the collectors being his
subordinates in this capacity, whilst he himself is
directly subject to the control of the Board of Revenue.
In most parts of Bengal, the collection of the ordinary
Land Revenue gives no trouble. The instalments of
the Government Revenue are paid in with a punctuality
which would gratify any Government under the sun.
This is one of the fortunate results of the much-abused
permanent settlement in Bengal, the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>mention of which is so like a red rag to a bull with
some persons, that we shall say no more about it,
except to observe that there are some other well-informed
persons who believe that if there had been no
permanent settlement in Bengal in 1793, there would
have been no British authority left in India in 1883.
According to the true British method of procedure,
the Government being now fully secure in its own
share of the Land Revenue from the land-owners, has
so altered and modified the laws which it made for the
protection of the land-owners in the collection of
their rents that it leaves them to collect them as
best they may. The latest device is to compel the
land-owner to sue his defaulting tenants in the civil
courts, as they are pleasantly called, so that the
Government derives a large indirect revenue through
its stamp laws, an <em>ad valorem</em> stamp being required
on the institution of a suit; whilst the costs of the
case are a heavy addition to the tenant’s rent if
the suit is decided against him, as it must almost
always be decided from the nature of things. But
this is all the result of pure benevolence and the well-meaning
but possibly misguided kindness of those
philanthropists who have constituted themselves the
champions of the poor tenant, with no very complete
understanding of the poor tenant’s real wants and
necessities. Be this as it may, the commissioner and
the collector have now very little trouble in the collection
of the Government land revenue in Bengal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Occasionally a landed estate, as it is officially called,
is sold by auction for non-payment of revenue; and
if the owner of the defaulting estate is dissatisfied,
he appeals to the commissioner to quash the auction
sale. But it is very seldom that an estate is sold at
auction, except with the wish and knowledge of the
owners. An auction-sale conveys a clear and indefeasible
title on the purchaser, who can thus afford to
pay a much higher price for the property than if he
attempted to buy it privately, for where there are
many shareholders in an estate it almost passes the
skill of the most able legal conveyancer to devise a
perfect title exhaustive of all previously existing rights
and encumbrances. With regard to the other revenue
duties of a commissioner, they are more easily enumerated
than they can be described or made intelligible.
He has to provide for the management of the estates of
minors, lunatics, and others, which have come under
the control of the Court of Wards. He has to keep
an eye on the great gains or losses arising from
alluvion and diluvion along the banks of the huge
rivers which sweep through Bengal, changing their
courses and washing away their banks, not merely by
a few yards, but sometimes by miles at a time. The
commissioner has to look after the excise revenue of
the districts under him. He must take thought
regarding the application of the stamp laws, and be
prepared to explain to the Board of Revenue the
reason why the stamp revenue increases in one district
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>and decreases in another district. This is sometimes
a rather difficult task, as the collector in whose district
an increase is shown blandly attributes it to the
abundance of the harvest; whilst, unfortunately, the
collector of the district in which a decrease appears
also attributes the decrease to the abundance of the
harvest; and though it is perfectly possible that there
may be some truth in each of these explanations,
it will not do for the commissioner to send up both
explanations to the Board in their conflicting nudity
and crudity. The commissioner has also to superintend
the collection of that very curious tax which is
known under the name of the license-tax. It is the
only existing form of direct personal taxation, and is
apparently called the license-tax because the Government
was not permitted to call it an income-tax. A
previous Government had taken much credit to itself
for the abolition of the income-tax, and neither
political party in England is now willing to allow
itself to be connected with the re-imposition of the
income-tax. But as some sort of direct taxation was
deemed necessary, and is admittedly necessary, in
order to reach the rich trading classes, it was introduced
under the name of a license-tax, whilst it is
only a disguised and deformed income-tax, utterly
failing to produce the amount which would be derived
from a well-administered income-tax, and only tolerated
because the taxpayers subject to it are well aware that
almost any change in the law is likely to add to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>amount of their taxation. The original income-tax
was abolished when it had begun to work, quite
smoothly, in Lower Bengal, and the chief defects of
the law had been eradicated and cured. Its ghost, the
license-tax, now reigns in its stead, and people
who pay the license-tax receive a license to do
nothing, or, in some cases, to carry on the business
for which they have to pay another license-tax under
the local municipal laws.</p>

<p class='c010'>The commissioner of a division has his head-quarters
at one of the principal stations of the
districts subject to his authority; but he is expected
to make at least one tour of inspection in the course
of the year, so as to visit all his districts. In some
divisions the railways now make travelling easy, and
his visitations can be made at any time that suits his
convenience. But there are some divisions in which
there are no railways, and even the local roads are
hardly passable except at certain times of the year.
In some parts the broad rivers afford the only means
of communication, and he has to travel by boat or
steamer. The commissioner’s visit of inspection in
remote districts is one of the important events of the
year. The officials, with their usual hospitality, make
every effort to welcome and entertain him. The
principal native residents of the district come in from
their country residences with a large band of their
retainers to pay their respects to him, and to represent
their wishes, and also their grievances. He has to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>inspect the public offices and to satisfy himself in many
matters of detail, such, for instance, as the amount of
treasure contained in the collector’s treasury, and the
number of stamps, including postage stamps, which
are or ought to be in the collector’s custody. He has
to visit all the local schools and pose as an amateur
examiner in history and mathematics and the vernacular
languages. He must inspect the local jail and
lunatic asylum; not interfering in their management,
as they are under special departments, but recording
in the visitor’s book his opinion on what he sees,
and on what he conceives to be wanting for the improvement
of these establishments. He must inspect
the old burial-grounds, and see that due care is taken
of the monuments and tombstones of the otherwise
long-forgotten dead. The opportunity of his visit
will probably be taken to hold a public meeting to
encourage subscriptions in support of some local
charitable institutions, such as hospitals and dispensaries,
or for the construction of some new work of
public utility, such as a new road or bridge. And if
any local feuds or factions exist, either among the
English residents or in different sections of the
native community, he is expected to act as a peace-maker,
and to devise a <i><span lang="la">modus vivendi</span></i> for the future.</p>

<p class='c010'>The duties of a commissioner are almost as varied
and numerous as it is possible to imagine, but he must
also fully appreciate the doctrine lately enunciated by
Mr. Gladstone regarding the duties of the Chancellor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>of the Exchequer. It is not sufficient that he shall
deal with all the work that comes to his hand, but he
must have time to look about him, and seek for and
make work, and initiate those reforms and improvements
for which there is such ample opportunity in
almost every condition of civilised society. He must
be prepared for disappointment as well as encouragement
in his endeavours to do good. Sometimes his
own subordinates fail to support or adopt his proposals,
or a zealous and active subordinate who
gladly and eagerly carried out his plans is removed to
some other sphere of usefulness, whilst his successor
is a man who cares for nothing but his own ideas and
abhors all unnecessary responsibility. Sometimes the
Government discredits and discountenances his well-meant
proposals, and he is graciously informed that
local knowledge is always wrong—a curious paradox at
first sight, but not by any means devoid of truth when
analysed from the broader Government point of view.
On the whole, the life and work of a commissioner is,
or ought to be, exceedingly enjoyable to a man of
active mind and body; but when mental and bodily
activity are impaired, it only remains for a commissioner
to retire like Mr. Colepepper to his native
country to spend the remainder of his days in dignified
repose.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are still several positions in the life of a
civilian which may be worthy of more than passing
notice. When an officer has elected to join the judicial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>branch of the service, he in course of time
becomes the judge of a district, an officer of much
authority and dignity, and not badly remunerated.
The position of a judge has one feature in it which
makes it highly commendable, especially in contrast
with that of the collector-magistrate, who has elected
the executive branch. The latter officer has many
masters, and his time is never his own, and even his
private house is not sacred against the invasions of
emergent business. But the judge has but one master,
the High Court. He goes to his court at a fixed hour,
and leaves it also at the appointed time, and he regulates
these hours according to his own convenience.
His business is carried on solely in his court; when he
leaves his court his work is at an end. It would be
considered both unbecoming and irregular for any
suitor or pleader to seek to follow him to his own
house. The duty of a judge is not so difficult as some
people suppose. It is a well-known truism that in
almost all law-suits the difficulty is to ascertain the
real facts of the case. If the facts are found, the
application of the law to those facts is a comparatively
simple process. In the court of a district judge there
are pleaders of good ability and considerable legal
acquirements, who are not likely to allow him to be
misled as to the law, however much they may strive
to twist the facts of a case in favour of their client.
The greater part of a judge’s work consists in hearing
appeals from the decisions of the native judges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>subordinate to him, so that he has only to deal with
the written evidence on the record, the effect of which
has been usually well-weighed and represented in the
decision of the subordinate judge. The judge, therefore,
can easily master the leading facts of a case as
set forth in the decision of the lower court, before he
begins to hear the arguments of the counsel who appear
to impugn or to support that decision. A case
may be more or less complicated, but for a man of
ordinary capacity and common sense it is a pleasant
intellectual entertainment to listen to the arguments
of the contending pleaders. Most of the leading
pleaders can speak English well, and state their cases
and arguments with a lucidity which might meet with
the approval of Matthew Arnold. It only remains for
the judge to prepare and pronounce his decision;
and if he is a prudent man he will write out his
decision in the quiet and privacy of his own study.
This is the more necessary because the judge’s decision
in its turn may become the subject of appeal to the
High Court, and it therefore behoves a judge to try to
make his decision impregnable.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most difficult part of a judge’s duty consists in
trying criminal cases at the sessions. When an accused
person is committed by a magistrate on a charge of
murder or any other offence with which the magistrate
cannot deal finally, he is tried by the sessions judge
and by a jury of his countrymen. The prosecution is
usually conducted by the Government pleader, whilst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>the accused retains the services of the best counsel that
he can afford to pay. The judge records the evidence
in English with his own hand, being himself the
interpreter of the actual words in the native language
in which it is delivered, whilst simultaneously a native
clerk records, or is supposed to record, the actual
words spoken by the witness. This imposes a severe
task on the judge. He has to listen to what the
witness says in the vernacular, he has to interpret
and record its meaning in English, and he has to consider
the effect of each successive question and answer
on the whole of the witnesses’ evidence. This triple
mental operation is very severe, and imposes too hard
a strain upon the judge. When the evidence for the
prosecution and the defence is completed, and the
counsel on either side have exhausted their eloquence,
the judge has the pleasure of summing up the evidence
and directing the jury in their vernacular
language, a rather arduous task, but we have heard
many men do it with much credit to themselves.
Perhaps some of our judges in England would not be
quite at ease if they had to sum up the evidence and
address an English jury in French, or in dog-Latin;
but the suggestion may convey to the reader some idea
of the difficulty to which an English judge in India is
subject. Finally, the judge records his decision elaborately
in English, in case the prisoner, if convicted,
should appeal to the High Court against his sentence.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the ranks of the district judges the best men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>are selected for a seat in the High Court of Calcutta.
It is not very easy to select the best men, and the
process of selection is uncertain, because the patronage
is exercised nominally by the Viceroy, who has the
least actual knowledge of the merits of individual
officers, and must therefore be guided by the advice of
others. We are prepared to admit that usually the
best men are selected, but on every occasion there are
several men who consider their own claims superior to
those of the officer selected. The position of a judge
of the High Court is certainly a very enviable one.
It may be said to combine almost the highest amount
of official dignity with no inconsiderable degree of
otium. In the usual routine of the court work two
judges sit together, and constitute what is called a
bench. When two judges are sitting together it
follows as a matter of course that one of them takes
the leading part in the conduct of the case which is
before them. Where two men ride on one horse, one
must ride behind the other. As a matter of practice,
where several cases come before them on the same day,
they take the conduct of the cases alternately; but
sometimes, where one judge is of a more masterly
temperament than the other, he practically assumes
the management of every case, whilst the other judge
acquiesces in the arrangement. This leads to a
powerful development of what has been called the
power of the cypher. One judge, Mr. A., is a masterly
man, and he scores as 1. The other judge follows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>his lead, and he therefore scores as 0. But 1 and 0
count ten, and in practice the working power of a
bench thus constituted is far more effective than that
of a bench where the two judges are antagonistic to
one another and are disposed to take conflicting views
of a case. It is therefore easy to conceive that whenever
a judge is not disinclined to subordinate his own
mental powers to those of his colleague, he can pass
his time on the bench without any great strain on his
intellectual faculties. He may be supposed to be
taking copious notes of the arguments, but as a fact he
is inditing an overland letter to his absent wife or
his children in England. When the case is ripe for
decision, and the arguments of counsel are at an end,
a brief conference with his colleague satisfies his conscience,
and he is prepared to sign his name in concurrence
to the decision more or less elaborate which his
colleague is ready to compose. The hours during
which the High Court sits are not very long or
exhausting. The judges usually take their seats at
11 o’clock, and after a sitting of three hours the
court withdraws at 2 o’clock for lunch, the contending
counsel gladly following their example. It is
nearly 3 o’clock before the judges resume their
seats on the bench, and by the time that the clock
has rolled on to 4, it begins to be a question
whether, on the conclusion of a particular case, there
is sufficient time to take up and finish a new case, and
so it not unfrequently happens that about 4 o’clock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the judges retire to their carriages and are driven
home to take their rest. At all events, 5 o’clock is
the appointed hour for their rising, be the case finished
or unfinished; so that it may be taken that about
five hours of work is considered a good day’s average
sitting. Each judge is accustomed to take one day in
the week at home for the purpose of writing out his
decisions, and for certain administrative and consultative
functions. It not unfrequently happens that a
judge, on arriving at court, finds that his colleague on
the bench is disabled by indisposition from attending
court, so that he is obliged to go home again for the
day, unless it so chances that another judge on another
bench is casually indisposed, and then the two odd
men may combine and make up a sort of scratch
bench between them for the day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whilst the ordinary daily work of a High Court judge
is not very severe, the judges are indulged in a much
longer vacation, and they have many more holidays
than any other class of Government officials. We do
not grudge them their holidays, and we are of opinion
that many Government officers would be much more
competent to work with full mental and bodily vigour
if they had a few more holidays and enforced periods of
rest. The judges of the High Court have an annual
long vacation extending over a period of two months,
from about the beginning of September to the beginning
of November, when the season, especially in
Calcutta, may be said to be most unhealthy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>unfavourable to the English constitution. The High
Court also closes for a week or ten days at Christmas,
and for a similar period at Easter. The native Hindoo
and Mahomedan holidays, which come on fixed or
variable dates, are religiously observed in the High
Court. An eclipse of the sun or moon, if visible,
becomes the occasion for a holiday, out of deference to
native feeling. We are sorry to say that there is a
growing tendency to mutilate and diminish the holiday
privileges of the judges. It was formerly open to them
to combine a month’s privilege leave, under the Service
Leave Rules, with the long vacation of the court, so
that they got a holiday of three months, which enabled
them to pay a flying visit to England. Sundry old
gentlemen at the India Office are said to have taken
offence at the sight of several High Court judges making
their appearance in London for a few days, and actually
entitled to their full pay whilst thus absent from duty.
This was the real <em>gravamen</em> of the offence. It has
always been a sort of principle in connection with leave
of any kind to mulct the delinquent of his official
salary, and so starve him into a return to his duty. It
was, therefore, deemed to be an infringement of this
principle that a judge should be seen walking about
London with his pockets full of rupees, just as if he
were in the streets of Calcutta. We are not able to
give the precise history of the official communications
between the India Office in London and the Government
of India at Simla. But it may be easily understood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>with how much virtuous zeal and good-will the authorities
at Simla set themselves to work to give effect to
the suggestions of the India Office. The Viceroy and
his Councillors, and the secretaries at Simla, are not in
the habit of taking any holidays. What are holidays
to them when they are living in a cool and healthy
climate, drawing salaries which were fixed on a scale
suitable to a warmer temperature? Their only avowed
relaxation is found in the interval of the moves from
Calcutta to Simla, and from Simla back to Calcutta,
when their offices are temporarily closed, and their
travelling expenses are defrayed by Government. The
financial secretary and his department always go to
Simla, and they never feel the beam that is in their
own eyes, however diligently they espy the motes when
an ordinary toiler in the hot plains wants his travelling
expenses paid. So it has come to pass that between the
parsimony of the India Office, where the scale of salaries
is notoriously so low, and the unsympathising sternness
of the Indian Government at Simla (sometimes called
Capua), the poor judges of the High Court have been
shorn of many of their leave privileges; and, even worse,
a reduced rate of salary has now been assigned to them.
At the end of the last century, we believe, some of the
judges of the old Supreme Court went to court in
palanqueens, with a stately retinue of sontaburdars,
and chobdars, and khidmudgars, and hookahburdars,
and chuprassies, and peadahs. Perhaps the time is not
remote when we shall see the impoverished High Court
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>judge making his way along Chowringhee Road in a
tram-car, and taking a dirty hired palkee to convey him
from the nearest point of the tramway to the entrance
of the court-house. The leading barristers of the court
make an income of £10,000 a year, and will probably
give an occasional lift in their carriages to the poor
judges who can no longer afford to keep a carriage and
horse of their own. Sometimes briefless young barristers
may be seen walking early to court, to spend
the day in the bar-library, and tramping back again at
sunset to their homes. They will hereafter probably
find themselves in the honourable company of some of
the under-paid judges of their court, who desire to
combine exercise with economy.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is one other position or grade in the Civil
Service which we must not omit to describe. A seat in
the Board of Revenue is the object of ambition set
before commissioners and all executive officers as the
reward of their persevering labours and acknowledged
merit. Unfortunately it is a haven which few are
destined to enter and to be at rest. In the good old
days, forty years ago, there were two Boards, each
Board consisting of three members. One Board was
styled the Board of Land Revenue, the other was the
Board of Customs, Salt, and Opium. Each Board had
its own separate office and establishment, and its senior
and junior civilian secretaries. In those good times
there was a chance for many men of arriving at the
dignity of a seat in one of the two Boards. But a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>wicked man was found, whose name must not be even
mentioned, who proclaimed to the world that “Boards
are screens,” and so the days of Boards were numbered,
and the screen which for so many long years had served
as a cover to the multitudinous sins of Government
(yes, of Government, and not of the Board itself) was
ruthlessly torn down. The Board consists now only of
two members, who are expected to carry on the work
for which six men were formerly needed, and their four
secretaries have been reduced to two. Nor is this the
only change. The Board is now a Board only in name.
The two members take charge of separate departments,
and each member carries on his work independently,
and without consultation with his colleague, except in
some few special matters which it is needless to
enumerate. One member takes the Land Revenue
Department, which provides him with plenty of employment.
The other member takes what is absurdly called
the Miscellaneous Land Revenue Department, which
includes the Excise, Customs, Salt and Opium, Stamps
and Stationery, and License-Tax Departments, with a
few odds and ends from the Land Revenue (proper),
such as the acquisition of land for public purposes, and
the partition of landed estates. Occasionally the two
members sit together to hear appeals, when there is a
probability that the decision of a commissioner will be
reversed, as the concurrence of both members is required
to set aside the decision of such an experienced
officer as a commissioner.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>An appeal before the Board is usually supported by
the most able counsel in the capital; and where the
litigants are wealthy it is not uncommon to see the
Advocate-General and two or three of the leading
members of the High Court bar arrayed on one side,
whilst on the other side the Government Solicitor-General
and several other barristers are retained
regardless of expense. Some serious dispute regarding
land has arisen, and though the intrinsic value of
the <i><span lang="it">causa belli</span></i> may be but small, it is a point of honour
which neither side can yield. In former days the
rival parties would doubtless have fought for it with
their bands of armed retainers; but in more peaceful
modern times it is safer, though not less expensive, to
retain a small army of lawyers. The case has probably
been locally investigated by a deputy collector, reinvestigated
and decided by a district collector, whose
decision has been disputed before the commissioner,
and now the final appeal lies to the Board of Revenue.
This is merely a sample of the kind of cases which
sometimes come before the members of the Board. In
less important cases, or in cases between less wealthy
and potent litigants, the services of counsel are almost
invariably engaged, and several of the native pleaders
who devote themselves to practise before the Board
are almost unrivalled in their knowledge of all the details
of revenue law, and also in the clearness and precision
with which they state the facts and the points of
their case. The appellate duties of the Board are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>much more important than is generally known or
understood, and as in very many cases each member
sits singly his labour is ordinarily quite as severe as
that of any two judges of the High Court when sitting
together as a bench.</p>

<p class='c010'>The greater part of the Board’s work is carried
on by correspondence, partly with commissioners and
partly with Government. The new letters are served
up daily to each member in boxes, with all the important
papers connected with each question. Lucid
notes and suggestions are put up by the secretary
subordinate to the member, so that the order to be
issued can usually be passed with comparatively little
difficulty, especially if the secretary is a man of
practical experience and sound ability. There is,
therefore, a smooth as well as a rough side to a seat
in the Board. The member can, if he pleases, dispose
of much of his correspondence in the quiet solitude of
his own house. He is practically master of his own
hours, and of his time for going to office and for leaving
it. Sometimes a member spends the whole day at his
office, and an instance has been known where a very
zealous member actually took up his abode at the
Board, so as to work uninterruptedly on some difficult
subject on which he was engaged. On the other hand
there have been members who only visited their office
fitfully and carried on the greater part of their work
at home. The members of the Board are also at
liberty to make tours of inspection into the interior,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>and, in fact, they are authorised and encouraged by
Government to make such tours, and occasionally
they are expressly deputed by Government to visit a
particular district to inquire and report upon some
difficult question. So upon the whole the members
of the Board lead a pleasant and well-employed life
individually, although they often enjoy collectively
the abuse and enmity of those who are under their
authority; and, on the other hand, the Government
usually takes advantage of the Board’s intervention
to give them the discredit of anything that does not
turn out satisfactorily, and to appropriate to itself
the credit of anything that has been done well. So
that the Board still continues to fulfil its old mission
as a convenient screen.</p>

<p class='c010'>The public generally may be said to mistrust the
Board, partly from its now suspected title, and partly
because it has no proper appreciation of those very
ponderous publications which are known as the Board’s
annual reports. The Board prepares and submits to
Government an annual report on each principal subject
that comes under its control. There is the annual
report on the Land Revenue. There are annual
reports on the Excise Department, on the Customs
Department, on Salt, on Opium, on License-Tax,
on Stamps, on Stationery, on the Shipping Office,
and whatever other miscellaneous subject is susceptible
of an annual report. Parliamentary Blue Books are
light and cheerful reading in comparison with most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>of the Board’s reports, but fortunately they find very
few readers. Nevertheless annual reports may be said
to represent the circulation of the blood in the whole
official community. Every official throughout the
country contributes his quota to them. The Board’s
reports may be compared to Aaron’s rod, as they
swallow up the reports of all their subordinates, and
reproduce them for the edification of Government.
For weeks, and even for months, some unfortunate
clerks in the Board’s office are toiling in the preparation
of the rough drafts and the figured statements
which form the basis of the Board’s reports. The
drafting clerk has the report of the previous year as
his immediate model, and his chief duty is to incorporate
in his draft the principal new facts and opinions
which he can glean from the new reports of the
officers subordinate to the Board. From time to time
the clerk consults the secretary as the work progresses,
and the day comes at last when the secretary takes
the draft into his own hands, and polishes it up into
a presentable shape. He then sends it off to the
printer for a broad-margined proof, and in this shape
it at last comes before the member of the Board, who
has to read and revise it, and put in a few patches of
adornment—or technical bunkum. When the report
is thus complete, it is submitted to Government.
When it has reached Government it is carefully
analyzed by a secretariat clerk, who prepares the
draft of a resolution on it. The Government secretary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>next dresses up the resolution and adds a few pungent
remarks, and submits it for the approval of the
Lieutenant-Governor. The Lieutenant-Governor is
expected to read the resolution which issues under
his authority, and it is to be hoped that he always
does so. The Government resolution is then communicated
to the Board, and the Board pass it on with a
copy of their report to their subordinates, many of
whom are anxiously looking out for it in the hope
of official praise, and in dread of some inconvenient
censure. And thus the report on each subject circulates
throughout the whole framework of the official
body; and subsides to rest until the coming of another
year sets it again in motion. Each annual report
may well bear the same motto, “<i><span lang="la">Adscribar numero,
reddarque tenebris</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We have very nearly exhausted the catalogue of the
various official duties to which a civilian may be
required to devote himself in the course of his career.
There are a few miscellaneous appointments connected
with the post-office and the sea-customs, and opium
and survey and registration, and there are the much-prized
but very laborious offices which the secretaries
of Government fill. But we will not weary our readers
with further details. The Civil Service, as a body, are
a hard-working and not over-paid set of men, considering
the heavy responsibilities which are imposed upon
them, and the great power which they have to exercise.
There are very few men, save a few prudent bachelors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>who are able to save anything like a competence from
their incomes. A man with a wife and rising family
soon finds his means consumed by the expenses of two
establishments, one in India and another in England,
and perhaps a third in the hills. There is no lack of
youthful candidates who are induced to enter the
service by the prospect of early independence and
a secured income, which tempts some of them into
early matrimony. But now that competition has introduced
into the service so many men of a very high
average ability, it may safely be said that almost all of
them would have done as well for themselves in any of
the liberal professions in England, if they could have
afforded to wait at home till their opportunity came.
It has been said that in some social points the men of
the new school are not equal to those of the old school,
but we doubt if this is susceptible of proof. There
may be this difference between them. The hard-bargains
of the old <em>régime</em> were chiefly their own
enemies; the hard-bargains of the new <em>régime</em> sometimes
manage to make themselves enemies by their
own conceit and indocility. But we have every reason
to believe and hope that the new race of men have
already been found to be no unworthy successors to
the traditions of the old service, and that they are a
body of men in whose character and services the
English nation may place full confidence.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='c009'>NATIVE LIFE IN INDIA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There are some people who seem to think that in
writing about social life in India, the first place should
be given to a consideration of the natives of the land.
But we say it with sorrow, though without shame, that
we can only add our testimony to that of many of the
best friends of India, that the more an Englishman
sees of India, the less competent he feels to write
about the natives of the country. They are a good and
loveable people, towards whom our hearts go forth only
too readily, but we never seem to come to a true and
thorough knowledge of them. The substance eludes
our grasp, and we find ourselves contemplating an
imaginary shadow. Possibly the day may come
when some traveller like Miss Bird, who has given
us such graphic accounts of the people of Japan and
the Sandwich islands, may find her way to Bengal,
and succeed in penetrating the veil of mystery.
But up to the present time we know of no English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>writer who has been able thoroughly to master the
whole subject. The natives themselves, from time to
time, tell us something about themselves, and we
find a very vivid picture of village life in Bengal in
the admirable novel called “Gobind Samunt,” which
was written some years ago by the Rev. Lall
Behari Dey. This, however, is a picture of the
natives painted by one of themselves. What the
English public want is a faithful picture of native
life, drawn by an Englishman or a foreigner.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is very natural to imagine that a member of
the Civil Service has the most favourable opportunities
of making himself acquainted with the natives.
He certainly may have some advantages over non-official
people, but, on the other hand, he is at many
great disadvantages compared with non-official people.
The official status puts him out of focus, if we may
use the expression; he sees the natives under a false
light, whilst they present themselves to his view with
a fictitious colouring. Most of our readers have heard
of Cicero and his writings and speeches. But it is not
everyone who has read Cicero’s treatise on the duties
of a magistrate. We shall try to explain, on the
authority of Cicero, how it comes to pass that in the
exchange of intercourse between the Indian civilian
and his native acquaintances, there is very much the
same difficulty as there was between a Roman officer
and the people of Asia Minor in days long past. It
happened that when Cicero was one of the Consuls at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Rome, in the zenith of his power, he had a brother
named Quintus, who was proprætor or governor of Asia
Minor. The ordinary term of a proprætor’s government
seems to have been for two years, but Cicero
managed to get an extension of service for his brother
for a third year. In sending the good news to his
brother, Cicero took the opportunity of writing him a
lecture, partly to show his own superior knowledge of
all sublunary things, and partly because it is tolerably
clear that the brother required a lecture. A little
good advice might do him good, and it could not do
him any harm. He was evidently an irascible, overbearing
man, but Cicero particularly desires it to be
understood that his hands were pure, and that he took
no bribes. Admitting this to be so, he seems to have
stood very much in the position which the Indian
civilian sometimes fills. He too is often suspected of
being irascible and overbearing, and is, fortunately, not
often accused of any want of honesty or high principle.</p>

<p class='c010'>With regard to the people of Asia Minor, Cicero
writes that the province is composed first of that kind of
allies who, of all the human race, are the most humanised,
and in the next place, of those Roman citizens
who are, either farmers of the public revenue or have
become rich by trade. Yet, he observes, “even among
these men serious disputes exist, many injustices are
committed, and great contentions are the consequence.”
Here, then, we have a sort of parallel with the people
of India. The natives themselves are proud of a civilisation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>which dates back to a period long anterior to
our own. There are English merchants and planters
and jute manufacturers settled in India, some of whom
become rich, and are also, unhappily, not free from
disputes between themselves and with the natives.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cicero warns his brother to be careful that the inhabitants
are not alarmed at his journeys, that they are
not frightened by his approach; that there should be
the utmost rejoicing, both public and private, wherever
he goes; that every town should seem to receive him
as its guardian, not as its tyrant. Do not these
remarks call to mind the progress of great Indian
officials with their large camps and retainers innumerable,
who are only too apt to prey upon the people of
the country through which they pass, unless the
most vigilant supervision is maintained? Even the
smallest civilian who goes out into camp in his district
will find that unless he himself sees that everything
is paid for, his servants and followers will
endeavour to live at free quarters in the name of
their master.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cicero says to his brother: “Let all the province
be sensible how dearly you prize the welfare, the
children, the fame and the fortunes of all who are
under your command. Let it be notorious that you
will be equally the enemy of the man who gives a
present as of him who receives it; for no one will give
when it is clearly perceived that those who pretend to
have the greatest interest with you are accustomed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>obtain nothing from you. It is not that I would have
you treat your dependants in a too severe and suspicious
manner. If you have got any person who has
been thoroughly admitted to your intimacy, consider
how far you ought to trust him—not but that there
may be many worthy men amongst the provincials,
this it is lawful to hope but dangerous to determine;
for every man’s nature is concealed with many folds of
disguise and covered with various veils. His nature,
his brows, his eyes and his countenance are deceitful;
and his speech is most commonly a lie. Where can
you find one who will sincerely love you, a mere
stranger to them, and not merely pretend to do so
for his own advantage? It would seem to me strange,
as these men seldom pay any regard to private men,
while they invariably attach themselves to the prætors.
If amongst such men you should find one (for the
thing is not impossible) who loves you more than he
does his own interests, enrol him as a friend; but if
you do not perceive this, there is no class of acquaintance
more to be avoided; because they know all the
arts of getting money, they do nothing but for money,
and they are indifferent about the opinion of any man
with whom they are not to continue to live. For the
Greeks in general are deceitful and treacherous, and
trained up by perpetual subjection in the art of
sycophancy. All of them should be liberally treated,
and the best of them received into friendship; but
too close intimacies with them are not very safe, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>though they dare not oppose your wishes, yet they
are jealous not only of our countrymen, but even of
their own. Though they dare not fly in the face of
a Roman magistrate, yet at the bottom they hate not
only us but their own countrymen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Those who have been invested with the official
authority which a civilian exercises during his career in
India can most easily tell how much there is in the
warnings of Cicero which comes home to their feelings.
Accustomed to receive every outward token of respect
and affection, they are hardly willing to ask themselves
the question why it was that such regard to themselves
as public officers was paid by the men who
seldom show much regard to any private men. Have
they never felt, when circumstances caused them to
be transferred from one district to another, how indifferent
their former admirers soon became towards
the man with whom they were no longer to continue
to live?</p>

<p class='c010'>From the very beginning of his career the civilian
is put in a peculiar position as to his native surroundings.
He has no difficulty in obtaining domestic
servants. He will do well to understand that in
India, as perhaps in other countries, although the
master fancies that he is selecting a servant, it is in
reality the servant who chooses his master. The
master is a sort of speculation into which the servant
enters, if it suits his convenience and is likely to pay.
A young civilian is certain to have a good income
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>and a respectable expenditure, out of which the servant
may make a profit. The young civilian will also
exercise official authority, and the servant speculates
that he will make some pickings out of it. A civilian
in high authority once remonstrated with his servant,
who professed to complain of too much work, and
asked him why, if he was dissatisfied, he did not take
service with some rich Calcutta merchant whose whole
day was spent at his office. “Sir,” replied the man,
“they have no visitors.” Whenever a native gentleman
comes to call at the house of a high official, the
native servants always expect a fee. The visitor pays
it, for the amount is not large, and he does not know
what might happen if he did not pay. There are many
petty slights, or really insults, which the servants
could pass upon him with impunity if he did not render
the accustomed tribute. And thus it comes to pass
that a civilian has no difficulty in obtaining and keeping
his native servants, provided that he treats them
with reasonable kindness and due consideration for
their shortcomings towards himself. The native
servants who surround a young man at the beginning
of his career sometimes have a considerable influence
on his subsequent demeanour towards all other natives.
It usually happens that a young man is delighted with
some of his first native servants, whom he finds so
intelligent and attentive and desirous of pleasing him.
The servant rises to the occasion, and is not slow to
attempt to help his master in matters which ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>not to be a subject of communication between them.
But the cause and effect are very natural. The master
returns home weary from his office, and has no one
to speak to but his servant. He casually mentions
something that has happened in office during the day,
or perhaps tries to ascertain from his servant if he
has rightly understood some explanation given to him
in the course of business. The servant is not slow to
profit by such an opportunity. When his master has
gone to bed the servant speeds off to the native town,
and soon finds out the particular case to which his
master must have alluded. He is thus in a position
to make the parties interested in the case believe that
he can influence his master on the subject, and the
possession of such a power is, of course, equivalent to
a mine of wealth. We can vouch for the truth of a
story regarding the head-servant of an officer, who
never exchanged a word with him on any official
business. But the servant was sufficiently clever to
make outsiders believe that he had great influence
with his master, and the time came when he gracefully
retired from his master’s service, and went home
to his native village to figure as a landed proprietor,
with a herd of several hundred head of cattle! Well
might Cicero warn the proprætor of Asia Minor
against putting too much confidence in his own
domestics, or in permitting them to abuse the show
of his authority.</p>

<p class='c010'>We next come to the civilian in his public office,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>where by the necessity of the case he is surrounded
and assisted by native subordinates of various ranks
and degrees of authority. These native subordinates
are to the English civilian in India somewhat in the
same position as the permanent clerks in an English
Government Office to the temporary ministerial
secretary. The civilian changes office only too frequently.
He is transferred from one district to
another. To-day he is an assistant at Dacca, to-morrow
he is joint-magistrate at Patna. The next
day he is collector at Calcutta. But wherever he
goes he finds himself introduced to a set of grave,
white-robed native officers, from whom he must try
to learn much of what has gone before, and through
whom he must conduct the business of the office in
which he presides. Many of these men have no want
of ability or experience. They have received some
education, and now-a-days are more or less conversant
with the English language. But their salaries are
small, and though they are much higher than the
salaries of former times, they are still insufficient to
meet the ever-increasing wants of modern civilisation
and expenditure. Each of these men will do his best
to ingratiate himself with his civilian superior. They
try to help him in all his difficulties, and are ready
to devote themselves to the execution of all his orders.
Hence it very naturally follows that their superior
takes a lively interest in them and welcomes their
aid; but it also very frequently follows that some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>them succeed in gaining a greater amount of favour
than their fellows. Not unfrequently one man becomes
his master’s special favourite and adviser. The sahib
learns to see everything through his favourite’s
spectacles, and to be guided, however unconsciously,
by his suggestions and promptings. The result is
inevitable. Those who have failed to gain favour
combine and intrigue against the favourite—but their
machinations fail. There is however, a Nemesis in
store. The civilian is transferred, and another officer
takes his place. The old favourite makes a struggle
to maintain his position and authority with the new
man, but probably in vain. The mere fact that he
was a favourite with Mr. A—— is sufficient to discredit
him with Mr. B——; and it sometimes, on the
other hand, happens that the native officer whose
influence with Mr. A—— was supreme finds himself
utterly indisposed and unwilling to render the same
allegiance to Mr. B——, however much Mr. B——
may have been inclined to appreciate him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next grade of native officials with whom the
young civilian comes in contact are the officers styled
deputy collectors and deputy magistrates, who exercise
a very large amount of authority, and constitute the
chief administrative staff of each district. These gentlemen
are usually men of large practical experience,
and if the young civilian has the good fortune to make
a friendly acquaintance with any of them he will find
them most valuable and useful friends and allies. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>can consult them with confidence in any matters that
are new to him, and they will gladly help him in his
official anxieties. But whilst the native deputy demeans
himself with due consideration and respect to all those
who are or may be in authority over him, there are
some of them who do not always lay their hearts open
to the advances of a young civilian. The old-fashioned
deputy who had risen from the ranks of practical
experience, and had never troubled himself with the
study of the English language, was usually a trustworthy
friend. But in recent times the graduates of
the Calcutta university, with their English accomplishments
and classical diplomas, have filled the office
of deputies, and they are not unusually of opinion that
they could do all the official work of the country much
better than the young Englishmen who are sent out
to manage the districts and practically rule the country.
It is much to be deplored, but it is unfortunately the
fact that an education in the English-teaching schools
and colleges does not ordinarily generate a sense of
affection for the English Government or its representatives.
The result is not unnatural. They have eaten
of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, and find that they
are naked. They see their English rulers in the enjoyment
of the best things which they naturally think
should have fallen to their lot, and they are not
disposed to be content with the good things which they
have obtained under the English Government. They
see that their English rulers are always ready to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>improve their position, and (not to put too fine a
point on it) to increase their pay. So they constantly
agitate for more pay and more power, and renewed
concessions have only the effect of producing increased
demands. Whether any concessions will satisfy them
is quite another question. When the subordinate
native judges, some years ago, had their pay increased
from £600 to £1,200 a year, one of them called on
a civilian judge, who proceeded to congratulate him
on his good fortune. “I am quite disgusted, Sir!”
replied the native gentleman. “I wanted to be appointed
to the Patna district, and the Lieutenant-Governor has
appointed me to Hooghly.” He did not pretend to care
for the increased pay which he had obtained, but he
still wanted something more. With regard to almost
any officer in this position of well-paid independence,
it might safely be predicated that if there had been no
English Government to provide him with employment
his paternal acres would have seldom yielded him an
income of £50 a year, and possibly, as the retainer of
some great man, he might have earned another £20
a year by some sort of service. But under no form of
oriental native government would he have dreamt
of a salary of £1,200 a year to be followed by a retiring
pension of £600 a year. Very few people are aware of
the very great strides by which the salaries of native
officers have increased. We could name four able men,
members of a middle class but talented native family,
who before 1850 were collectively drawing pay which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>gave them £400 a year, and they were not discontented.
In 1870, these same four men had so floated upwards
with the stream that their united income was not less
than £4,000 a year, and still they were hoping for more.</p>

<p class='c010'>We began this paper by protesting against the
incompetence of an Englishman to give a satisfactory
account of the natives of India. But we will now
give a special reason for this. The women of the
country are a sealed book to the stranger. He has
no opportunity of seeing them or speaking to them,
and he can learn very little about them. Let anyone
imagine the case of a native Indian gentleman
coming to England, or France, or America, and
having his eyes closed to the whole of the female
population. In India, as long as a woman has any
youth and beauty she is kept in strict seclusion
from the public gaze. In large towns in certain
quarters a few painted Jezebels may be seen looking
down from their upper stories, but otherwise an
European visitor might believe that youth and
beauty did not exist in the land. And not only
does the eye never behold the best portion of the
female sex, but a rigid etiquette must be observed
in conversation with a native gentleman in even
alluding to the female members of his household.
But it is not to be supposed that women in India
do not exercise a considerable influence upon the
men. They are doubtless good mothers, good wives,
and affectionate sisters. They have their strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>religious feelings, and are seldom negligent of the
duties connected with the domestic worship of their
household gods. But to the foreigners they are
practically unknown. One might as well attempt to
give an account of the terrestrial system, recognising
the power of the sun, but utterly ignoring all the
more genial influences of the moon. Perhaps the
time may come when the women of India may
assert themselves more publicly, and insist on the
enjoyment of those privileges which their European
sisters have as their birthright; but until that time
comes, how can any Englishman venture to write
about the real people of India? A civilian has no
more true knowledge of the female portion of the
native population than a native has of the members
of the English peerage. Even in his court, as a
magistrate, women are seldom brought forward, either
as criminals or witnesses, though occasionally some
sort of she-wolf is arraigned for having murdered
some unfortunate child for the sake of its ornaments.
Or it may be that some quarrel about a woman has
led to a murderous dispute, and perhaps a muffled
bundle of clothes said to contain a female is produced
as a witness in the case before him. But it is exceedingly
difficult even to understand the language as
spoken by a woman, and he would certainly be a bold
person who would venture to generalise on the national
female character from such specimens as he may
casually see from time to time in court.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Still we are unwilling not to record a grateful
reminiscence of the many kindnesses which we have
received at the hands of many influential and wealthy
native friends. How could our official duties have been
performed with any amount of satisfaction or success,
without the able and intelligent assistance so freely and
zealously rendered by those over whom we were set in
authority? And how can we forbear from acknowledging
the long and unwearying faithful services of
successive generations of native servants, who so often
anticipated our wishes and carried out our orders to
the best of their ability!</p>

<p class='c010'>It is the privilege of every civilian officer to have
the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the principal
native gentlemen of the district in which he is
employed. Soon after his arrival at a new station they
come to call on him; whilst those who live within a
convenient distance, and are inclined to be sociable,
repeat their visits at intervals. There are, unfortunately,
some native gentlemen who seem to think it unnecessary
or undesirable to make such calls; and as the ways
and habits of different civilians differ considerably,
there are some officers who do not encourage such
visits, so that their successors have some difficulty in
making it known that they will gladly receive visitors.
It is unnecessary to analyse too minutely the particular
object which each visitor has in calling; but it is much
better for a civilian to run the risk of any abuse of the
opportunity by his visitor, than to shut his door upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>a mere suspicion. Most native gentlemen are far too
honourable to attempt any allusion in the course of
their visit to any subject which it would be unbecoming
to mention; and if any such attempt were made, it is
easily in the power of the officer receiving the visit
to put the subject aside with due regard to his own
dignity. But the benefit, and pleasure, and information
which are to be derived from such visits far outweigh
any inconvenience or annoyance that may possibly
arise from them. It is true that a portly native
gentleman, whilst uttering the usual formal compliments
of introduction, does not always remember to
suppress those ebullitions which are considered amongst
his own people to be indicative of his having enjoyed
his breakfast; it is true that the language of polite
flattery is sometimes rather over-strained; but when
the first effervescence of such frothy nothings has
subsided, the time will come when the visitor will work
down to his natural powers of conversation, according
to the capacity which he possesses. It is to be observed
that two native gentlemen calling at the same time
prefer to be received separately, unless, of course, they
have some common object in calling; but, on the other
hand, an officer in a high position will often find his
advantage in having his visitors admitted simultaneously,
especially if he has one day of the week particularly
set apart for the reception of his native visitors.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it may be said that these kind of visits do not
amount to social intercourse. Certainly not. Nor, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the other hand, do we admit that there is any social
intercourse, in the true meaning of the word, where the
official goes to a party at the house of a wealthy native
gentleman, to some special entertainment such as a
nautch or fireworks in honour of a wedding or any
other domestic occurrence. It will be admitted that
two of the main elements of social intercourse according
to English ideas consist (1) in dining together, (2)
in the interchange of ladies’ society. But the native
gentleman will seldom come to dine with the English
gentleman; and although an English lady has no
objection to receive the visit of a native gentleman, or
to go to his entertainments, there seems to be little
prospect at present of seeing a native lady come forth
to welcome the English visitors at her husband’s
house. Behind the mere external difficulties there
come all the complications of caste and religious
observance, and also of dress, of which the etiquette
is almost unfathomable. The natives themselves are
not in accord with one another on many points which
come into prominence in their contact with English
society; and although many parties are now given in
the capital of Calcutta and in other large towns by
high officials on the one hand, and by native gentlemen
on the other hand, where people of both races
meet for one or two hours, we fear that on such occasions
there is very little real mutual enjoyment, and
that the hosts are usually very glad when the last of
the guests has departed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Several wealthy native noblemen and gentlemen in
the interior keep a neatly-furnished bungalow or house,
in which they can entertain their English friends who
visit them on their estates for the sake of hunting and
shooting. In the Burdwan district the late Maharajah
used in former years to entertain parties of his English
friends at the Dilkoosha and Kishensaugor garden-houses,
especially at the time of the Burdwan Races.
We could name several other similar places, but we
must give the preference to the recollection of the
happy days spent in the country house of our good old
friend Rajah Kalinaraian Roy of Dacca. He had
built a suite of apartments contiguous to his own old
native palace, and it was his pleasure to invite his
English friends from Dacca to come out and stay with
him, to shoot tigers and hunt wild hogs. His property
was very extensive, and contained a great portion of
the Madhupore jungle, which runs more than fifty
miles to the north of Dacca, with an average breadth
of about ten miles. The ground is undulating and
slightly hilly in parts, and is well intersected with
streams of fresh water, so that it afforded a good
harbour for all sorts of game, tigers, leopards, bears,
buffaloes, sambur and spotted and hog deer, and a
few wild boars, with a fair sprinkling of hares and
partridges and jungle-fowl, and occasionally a woodcock.
An easy drive of about twenty miles from
Dacca brought the visitors to the Rajah’s palace,
where the Rajah was sure to be ready to greet them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>on their arrival. He was a fine-looking man, with
pleasant features and a strong vigorous figure. When
he came out to join the shooting-party on his elephant
he used to be stripped to the waist, and his shoulders
and chest were covered with thick grey hairs, which were
suggestive of the <span lang="grc">στηθεσσιν λασιοισι</span> of Homer. A little
fillet of white muslin bound round his temples protected
his head from the sun; but of course his servant behind
him in the howdah always carried an umbrella. He had
a good battery of guns and rifles, and was a very good
shot. It was almost always a sure sign that there
was a tiger to be got when the Rajah came out with
the party. The visitors were always ready to go out
at any time to shoot whatever turned up, as they had
come out for perhaps only a few days’ holiday and
must take their chance. One great advantage of the
shooting at the Rajah’s was that we usually went after
a tiger on receiving information of “a kill.” An
excited peasant would come rushing in with the news
that his cow had just been killed, and imploring the
Rajah to go out to take revenge. It was a pleasure to
see the Rajah’s face when he felt sure that the information
was true, and from his knowledge of the
country he also was certain that the tiger was watching
the carcase from a patch of cover which could be
conveniently beaten by the elephants. By approaching
the cover judiciously, and with due regard to the
wind, we were almost certain to find a tiger, and it
was our fault if it was not killed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>The Rajah was a large landholder, and the visitors
at his house had a most favourable opportunity of
seeing how he managed his property and conducted
his affairs with his tenants and his neighbours. The
people flocked in daily in considerable numbers to
attend the Rajah’s office, and if they had leisure they
would come and have a good stare at the English
visitors. The principal part of the office-work was
carried on by the Rajah’s native ministerial officers of
various grades and titles; but he almost invariably took
his seat in office for an hour or two, and had no
objection to our going to hear what passed between
him and his people, for he was always courteous and
considerate to them, and their complaints and
grievances were not often directed against him, but
were chiefly the result of petty disputes among themselves
about caste and other such matters of which
the Rajah was a highly competent judge. He would
occasionally order a fine to be paid, or compensation
to be levied from the delinquent party, and disregard
to such an order was seldom exhibited. It sometimes
happened that our visits to the Rajah’s palace were
paid on the native holidays and festivals; and on these
occasions the whole country-side used to flock to the
entertainments given at the Rajah’s expense. It is
hardly necessary to say that he distributed charitable
gifts in food and money day by day to a considerable
number of religious mendicants and professional
beggars; but on the great holidays or festivals the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>expenditure of gratuitous food was something enormous,
and due respect was shown to the visitors according
to their various ranks and grades in native society.
Music and song and dancing would last long past
midnight, and few of the guests were allowed to go
away empty-handed. It would be difficult to imagine
a more genial and healthy state of relations than that
which existed generally on the Rajah’s estates between
him and his people. Doubtless many of them were
poor and ignorant, but the mild despotism with which
the Rajah ruled them required very little tempering
from the interference of English law or officials.</p>

<p class='c010'>With regard to his English visitors, the Rajah
showed the kindest hospitality. He did not object if
they took out their own provisions and wines, and
their own cook, for the better preservation of their
own health. But the Rajah always had supplies
of food provided for his visitors, and his wines were
undoubtedly the most costly that could be purchased
by him from the Armenian shops in Dacca. The
Rajah would usually look in to see his visitors when
breakfast was nearly over, and preparations were beginning
for the day’s sport. But his great delight was to
come in at dessert when the visitors had done their
dinner, and he would not object to smoke a quiet
cigar with them. He was full of fun, and liked his
little jokes and puns, especially if any visitor had any
knowledge of the Persian language to enable the
Rajah to show his proficiency in that tongue. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the Rajah did not know English, his education having
been completed in the olden time, when Persian was
the Court and fashionable language. He was full of
anecdotes connected with shooting, and the various
adventures with tigers in which he had shared with
the best sportsmen from Dacca for a long course of
years. He was a capital mimic, and it was easy to
recognise his imitation of some of the old sportsmen
in their moments of excitement. He used to have his
little son and daughter brought into the room in their
smartest native dresses. The son has now grown up,
and is a worthy and liberal successor to his father.
The daughter came very quickly to the marriageable
age, and after she was married it was no longer permissible
for her to come down and talk to strange
gentlemen. But she used to take opportunities of
seeing the visitors, she herself being unseen; and, as
a fact, the visitors were almost always paraded quietly
so that they might be seen by all the ladies of the
Rajah’s household. He had two wives, of whom the
eldest was childless, the second wife being the mother
of his two children. To those with whom he was
best acquainted he was in the habit of discoursing
about his domestic affairs, and, if imperious native
custom had not forbidden it, we believe that he would
have been very willing to have introduced them to his
wives, when English ladies were of the party, they
were always taken into the inner apartments to make
the acquaintance of the ladies. Perhaps one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>most curious illustrations of the incongruity of native
and English feeling occurred during one of our visits.
The Rajah’s daughter had been married to a Kulin
Brahmin of the highest caste, who lived with her at
the Rajah’s palace. But as he was a man of specially
high caste, it was his privilege to be married to any
number of wives whose parents could pay for their
espousal to him. And so we became accidentally
witnesses of the occasion on which the young husband
set forth with a grand marriage procession from
his own first wife’s house, in order to be married
to another young lady of high family. It is an
Hindoo institution, and it was not in the Rajah’s
power to resist it for his own daughter’s sake. But
to the English visitors, especially to the ladies who
were present, the whole proceeding seemed very uncomfortable,
and the more so as we were fully aware
that the Rajah and his daughter were, in their inmost
hearts, most averse to what was taking place.</p>

<p class='c010'>As we have ventured to write of our old Hindoo
friend, Rajah Kalinaraian Roy, we feel bound to
speak in no less grateful terms of the chief Mahomedan
zemindars in Dacca, the Nawab Khajeh Abdul
Gunnee, and his son, the Nawab Khajeh Ahsanoollah.
They too had a shooting-box at a convenient
distance from Dacca, to which they would invite their
English friends, and they kept a stud of about twenty
elephants, some of which were of the finest and
staunchest of their kind. They were most liberal and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>good-natured in lending their elephants to those whom
they could trust, though there were always plenty of
elephants at Dacca, as it is the head-quarters of the
Government elephant depôt. Many years after I had
left Dacca, they sent a couple of elephants to meet
a friend of mine nearly a hundred miles from Dacca,
when he wanted them with the Calcutta Tent Club. In
every public and private work of utility and charity
both father and son were equally munificent. They
sent their handsome contributions to the subscriptions
raised for various charitable purposes in England.
They were always amongst the first to give whatever
was needed for the improvement of the town and district
of Dacca, and for the good of its inhabitants.
To the poor and needy they never turned a deaf ear,
and whenever an opportunity presented itself they were
always ready with their handsome entertainments in
honour of the Lieutenant-Governors or any other great
people who visited Dacca. We wish them long life and
prosperity. But we must reluctantly put an end to the
record of those many pleasant days which we spent in
Dacca, nearly twenty years ago, with this imperfect
acknowledgment of how much was due to the kindness
of our Hindoo and Mahomedan friends there.</p>
